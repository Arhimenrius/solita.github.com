title: How to buy a Software Project
author: empperi
excerpt: We are doing agile projects but at the same time we aren't. The reason to this is in the way software projects are bought.

Today most of the software projects done out there use agile methods. We have sprints, product backlogs, kanban boards and so forth. Today's customers require use of agile methods in the projects which is a good thing. Waterfall has been proved to be a wrong way to do things time and a time again.

However there is a problem. The way most of the projects are bought do not support agile methods in the least and in fact they force to something wierd which isn't quite waterfall and it isn't quite agile either. In the best case scenarios these projects end up feeling like agile and in the worst case they are very very far away from agile projects. I'll first describe this model which is used so commonly in the tendering process and then go forth to the suggested model which would truly support agile methods.

 ## The way it is now

 When the customer recognizes a need for some software system which it needs to buy from an outside organization they start to gather requirement specifications. In some cases the customer creates these specifications themselves and in other cases they start a separate tendering process for finding a parter which will help them in creating this document. In this document they will gather all the requirements they can think of which might be important for the future system and it is used as a baseline for the future tendering process for the actual system. After the requirements specification has been made a significant amount of money and time is spent since creating a comprehensive requirements specification is not a small task - most likely tens of thousands of euros is spent and in some cases hundreds of thousands or even millions.

 Next the customer starts a tendering process for the actual system. They send the created requirements specification along with more accurate rules for participating in the tendering for all participant organizations. How these organizations are found depends on the case, but in some cases anyone can participate and in others the customer chooses the participants from a pre-selected list.

 The rules included in the tendering vary, but they usually contain at least the following:

 * The vendor shall provide a comprehensive list of the development team which will implement the product along with the CVs and project history of all of them
 * The product must be delivered within a certain time frame
 * Failing to deliver the product in an agreed time frame and/or budget will lead to penalties such as loss of income for the vendor
 * The project must be done by using agile methods, preferably Scrum

 Now all the organizations wishing to participate in the tendering dig in to the requirements specifications and start making estimates of how long it would take to create such a system as described in the document. All of the participants know that their rivals will try to outbid them and so they all try to get the price as low as they can go. In many cases they go lower than they think is realistic because that's the only way they can truly compete.

 Of course the vendor is chosen by other factors too than just mere price. The experience of the team is an important factor as is also the promised delivery date.

 After the customer receives the bids they (usually) choose the lowest one but in some cases the quality factors may allow the second lowest bid to win. After this contracts are made and the project is started.

 ## What's wrong with this?

 The described process drives off the road (and badly) right in the beginning: when the customer starts a project to create a requirements specification.
