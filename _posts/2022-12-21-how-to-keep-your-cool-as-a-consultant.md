If you're a person who doesn't really react to changes and who can adjust to new situations with a shrug, this post is probably not for you. If, however, you're more like me and you have trouble adapting to big changes and you need conscious effort to calm down, this might be for you.

## How's it been

This year is starting to reach its end. I started to reflect how this year had been and what I hope I can do better next year. We had some upheavals in my project a few weeks ago and my work life was being tossed upside down (or at least that's how it felt at the time). Luckily, things weren't that bad (who would've known?!) and I've managed to find my footing again.

I do my job with my whole personality. It can be both a positive and a negative thing. When I feel happy and content, I have lots of energy and I'm willing and able to give the work 100 %. I'll be willing to do tasks that are tedious or boring. But the flip side of that coin means that when things get rocky in a project, I feel it strongly and my emotions are all over the place. It takes a while for me to calm down after each upheaval. And if things get really bad (like "this is the last straw" bad) I just stop caring altogether and then my attitude is pretty much ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯. (And just to be clear, that is not a sustainable situation and not caring is so out of character to me that even the smallest things start to rub me wrong way and it's just a situation bound to get worse and worse.)

When rapid changes happen, it takes a while for me to adjust to the new situation. I wrote something along the lines of "I prefer stability over fast changes" to my cv in Solita's internal cv bank. A colleague who was proofreading it said that it sound like I prefer waterfall development over agile methods. I then realized my colleague and I thought of very different kind of changes. What I had had in my mind at the time of the writing were more along the lines of customer announcing "we're not going to been half you after this sprint, good bye", not if we should try a new kind of retro template this week. In the small everyday situations I can be very flexible (as long as I have some familiar things), but those big "announcements" are really not easy for me to handle.

I've gotten advice that I should "let things slide" and care less, but that is super hard for me. And if I start to care less, after a while I'll become cynical and not care about anything. I know this is something I should work on, so I'd be able to care up to a point but not too much.

## So why be a consultant?

I do not believe the grass is really that much greener elsewhere. Of course, I could find a job in a product house or maybe even from the government. There I most likely wouldn't have problems like in my current job. But that does not mean that there wouldn't be any problems. They'd just be different kind of issues. I might be happier for a short period of time but after a while I'd start noticing things that'd eventually evolve into problems.

I'm not trying to say working in a non-consultant company is a bad option or that you couldn't be happy there, far from it. I'm just saying that I do not believe it to be a silver bullet that magically makes everything work smoothly.

This is the part where being a consultant is a large company comes in handy. I am not tied to my current project until the end of time. When a project starts to feel like too much (or too little sometimes), I can ask to be rotated to a new project. I get to work with new people, possibly learn a new domain, maybe work with different technologies, all the while staying at the same company. 

At least here at Solita we're offered possibilities to learn. The learning may happen in your daily project work or you can take time from your project to learn what you feel like is important to learn. We have internal courses which anyone can develop and share their knowledge about a subject. There's also links to external materials, like books in O'Reilly's platform. 

## What keeps me cool (or at least cooler...)

At Solita, one of the most important things keeping me fit to work is my people lead. I know having an administrative manager is not ideal for everybody. But to me it is super important that there is this one person who cares about me and who I've built trust with over the years. I really can't see myself working in a company where you're supposed to contact an hr person and it might be a different person every time. 

Another thing helping me is Solita's culture. I feel it's okay not to be happy and content all the time. I can out my frustration freely both to other "normal" colleagues as well as to colleagues working in managerial positions. A few times I've talked with my project manager and just poured my heart out and told that everything is sh*t. And they've listened to me and after I've calmed down asked what concrete steps could be taken to make things easier.

Also, feedback is asked from all Solitans regularly. I think it currently every three weeks that we get a link to a Peakon questionnaire. Many times in my answers I've told about smaller or bigger things bothering me. For me, a service like Peakon's is good, because the anonymity allows me to say about issues I might not raise if I had to say them with my face & name from the very beginning.

## Tips and tricks for tough days

**Take a break** (seriously I should learn to take my own advice). Take some time for yourself. Personally, I like to take a tea break and just sit for a while. For you, it might be something else altogether. Learn what gives you the chance to calm down.

**Talk to someone**. Talking to my people lead has helped me trough a lot. It feels like no matter what's bothering me, she can help me understand different points of views and to find a way to cope. Also, I have some colleagues I'm close to and I can vent to them when I face difficult situations.

**Leave work a bit earlier**. If you have the possibility to use flex time, do that. If a week is too much, cut it short. At least for me, leaving just an hour or two earlier and doing something nice makes a world of difference. For example, in Finland's winter that might make it possible to see the sun (or some daylight at least).

## Conclusion

Find trust. Everything usually works itself out. If things get hard, find someone to talk to or just to be with, don't be alone with your worries and thoughts.
