Solita wanted to have their own beer. We had our internal voting for the taste of the beer and passion IPA won the contest. At 21.6.2016 we got chance to taste 20l of the beer and make adjustements to it. All started with bus trip from Solita's office at Helsinki to Tuusula. We had great time already in the bus in discussion of projects and in expectations of the upcoming beer. 

## Maku brewing

Maku brewing is finnish craft beer brewery. They are making great beers. Their IPA is best most likely the best IPA in the Finland and it has also been awarded. Their amber ale is also great and has been awarder as well.

## Tasting notes

Smell and taste had refhresing taste of passion fruit as we wanted. Citra hop created bitterness in the end that was suitable for any summer beer. 

## Brewing process

We got introductionary into Maku Brewing brewing process. They like to start their process with 20l braumeister (that was the original investment). After they have evaluated the receipt enough they change into 3000l mashing vessel. After mashing the product will be transferred into fermentation tanks. In fermentation tanks the end product will be from few weeks to months depending on the type of the beer. 

## Final notes 
Our end product will be ready at the october 2016. It will be just in time for Solita's 20 years party! Company ordered the most of the beer but employees took about one third of the endproduct eventhough they needed to pay for it. Payment process was not made that simple (you know the finnish law) because Solita could not take payment from employees salary.
