Solita wanted to have their own beer. We had our internal voting for the taste of the beer and passion passion ale won the contest. At 21.6.2016 we got chance to taste 20l of the beer and make adjustements to it. All started with bus trip from Solita's office at Helsinki to Tuusula. We had great time already in the bus in discussion of projects and in expectations of the upcoming beer. 

Here is our passion pale ale in the glass.

## Maku brewing

[Maku brewing](http://www.makubrewing.com/) is few years old finnish craft beer brewery. They are making great beers. Their IPA is best most likely the best IPA in the Finland and it has also been awarded. Their amber ale is also great and has been awarder as well. After fitting 20 nerds into a bus we got introductionary into their brewery by Henri Parviainen who is just leaving the IT business and starting to be full-day at brewery. 

Here we are at the bottling chamber. It serves also as a warehouse.

There were plenty of great contesters but I have to admit that I was imressed by the winner. Winner created 3D model that can be found at [this website](http://dev.makarainen.org/intohimo/)

Committee that chose winner said that the winner was able to combine design and techinical skills in a Solita like manner. Colleagues said that the lool and feel was really fresh with artistic passion, everything fits!

## Tasting notes

Smell and taste had refhresing taste of passion fruit as we wanted. Citra and Jarrylo hops created bitterness in the end that was suitable for any summer beer. We were happy about how well passion fruit came out in both smell and taste. We had 20l test series and we were so happy that we let Maku to continue without making any changes. 

Fellow from Solita got there before me and wrote this [blog](http://tuopillinen.blogspot.fi/2016/06/pieni-yritysvierailu-maku-brewingille.html) about the tasting in finnish. 

## Brewing process

We got introductionary into Maku Brewing brewing process. They like to start their process with 20l braumeister (that was the original investment). After they have evaluated the receipt enough they change into 3000l mashing vessel. After mashing the product will be transferred into fermentation tanks. In fermentation tanks the end product will be from few weeks to months depending on the type of the beer. And finally the end product will be of course canned or bottled.

I have no pictures about tanks, because well... they were tanks and was not that interesting. But here are some machines with electronics!

## Final notes 

Our end product will be ready at the october 2016. It will be just in time for Solita's 20 years party! Company ordered the most of the beer but employees took about one third of the end product eventhough they needed to pay for it. Payment process was not made that simple (you know the finnish law) because Solita could not take payment from employees salary. Nevertheless the beer was one for my tasting and I am happy to pay for it.
