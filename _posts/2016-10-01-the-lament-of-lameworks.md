# The lament of lameworks

A poem.

*Contains (probably) Finnish nerd humor. All political references are strictly literary!*

![Frameworks - conception](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-1.png)

Buy framework to help you with multiple things,

especially easy ones, cope with its sins:

luxury, lewdness, and catastrophe.

A framework is more than a [Bobrikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Bobrikov)!

![Frameworks - 2](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-2.png)

It helps you in night of your loneliness

to have its one api of completeness.

Unity, vacuity, catastrophe!

A framework is more than a [Bobrikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Schauman#Assassination)!

![Frameworks - 4](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-4.png)

When production looms it is all sorted out

and sticks out its head in stacks for a lout -

pages and pages of catastrophe -

a framework is more than a [Bobrikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Bobrikov)!

![Frameworks - 5](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-5.png)

Go happily married and fix all its sins

by ad hoc solutions and hacks in neat bins

and curse your dear reason for catastrophe.

A framework is more than a [Bobrikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Schauman#Assassination)!




# Full stack developers

"Her stack? just love her", said John Webster in interview,
being asked about Kibana for a Senior Engineering position.
He was told to study Elastic,
got the job -

In spite of sexist/jerk implications
which he had not stifled, only smiled at - and rather obscenely at that.

Can you expect from a person to know intimately three or four formal languages,
a few dozen libraries, a few protocols, processes -
and be a decent human being with that kind of mind?
