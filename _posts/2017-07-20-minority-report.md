We got feedback that the pictures used in the recruitment announcements give a little biased picture of typical employee at Solita. They show mostly about 30 year old white males. Well, that's true, because I think at least the majority of developers in Solita are about 30 year old white males. Of course, in reality there are plenty of us, some male, some female, all in different bodies. The pictures in the advertisements are not a statement what a typical developer should look like. What really matter are skills, personality and how Solita-like you are. ([One true story](http://dev.solita.fi/2017/04/07/solita-java-trainee.html))

## Real people - no photostock

In my opinion it is great that Solita uses authentic pictures of real employees in these advertisements. Some of the pictures are even shooted in real situations during the work day. At least the one I'm in presents a real case where we were debugging the software with a colleague when the photographer just came out with his camera. I think that picture is used e.g. for recruiting integration specialists. It must be remembered, that the picture chosen in the announcement is always a partial glimpse to the day in life in Solita. I'm not a integration specialist and we were not recruiting especially women.

## Working as software developer

I've worked as a software developer in Solita already for ten years. I've had opportunity to work in various projects and with several co-workers. It's true that women are few in software development. I just calculated that I've had a female fellow-programmer only in one project but maybe in compensation there were not only one but two of them in that project. The minority of female developers sticks out every autumn, on Solita developer days in Sappee, where we have one cottage rented for female developers and eight cottages for male developers.

According to my experience the working with a female software developers is pretty much like working with a male software developers. Furthermore, I suppose that working as a female software developer is quite similar as working as a male software developer. (However, this I can't be entirely sure of, due to lack of personal experience.) My colleague nicely wrote about [being a software developer in Solita](http://dev.solita.fi/2017/03/24/being-a-software-designer-at-solita.html).

I believe that Solita does not make any difference in recruiting male or female employees, the main point is just recruiting brilliant developers. I think that the problem emerges already at school before high school and university. The ability to make choices regardless of sex should be enabled, allowed and also encouraged. At least in my days in the Helsinki University of Technology, there were lack of female students in certain branches of science, e.g. Information Technoclogy and Electrical Engineering.

## Suitable for girls?

My mother who was interested in chemistry at school was told by the rector before appliying to university that studying chemistry is not suitable for girls. Hence, she found her career elsewhere. I was told by our study advisor in 9th grade that the extensive courses for mathematics and physics in the high school were not suitable for girls. I guess he was trying to make a joke. However, I did not believe him and neither did many of our class.

So, after these experiences, I hope that some one has already told you that being a software developer is suitable for both sexes. If not, I'll tell you now, that males have no special software developer gene. The profession is suitable for anyone.

## Be yourself

I happily welcome all new female developers to Solita, but I also welcome with same happiness all other new colleagues. As Solita promises to all employees "You can be yourself with all your excellences".
