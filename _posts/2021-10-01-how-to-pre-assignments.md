# Working title: Do's and Dont's of Dev Academy Pre-assignments

## README

If your project is published in github, the first thing the reviewer will see of your pre-assignment is README. With good README the reviewer gets a clear picture of your project even without looking at the code or running it. 

Good README includes following things:

- Prequisites. Are there some things that need to be installed on reviewers computer before they can compile and run the project? Is the project working only on windows or only on linux? List things that need to be done before trying to run the project. If versions are important, remember to include those as well.
- Configurations. Do you have to config for example database connections locally? Provide clear instructions what needs to be changed and where.
- How to run the project? Do you have to install some packages or compile the code? If you have separate services for example for backend and frontend, remember to write instructions for all needed services.
- Tests. If your project has tests include instructions how to run them. 
- Description of the project. What is the purpose of the project and what features it has? 
- Technology choices. List chosen technologies. It's also nice to know, why you ended up with those technologies.
- TODO. If there are some things missing or not working, you can list them to README. That way the reviewer knows that you thought of them and also doesn't waste time looking for them or trying to figure out if something works or not.
