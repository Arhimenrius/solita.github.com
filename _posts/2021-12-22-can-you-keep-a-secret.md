# Preface
We are currently building an app that has sensitive data. Both applications are available 
worldwide and therefore our backend is not geofenced. Our apps communicate with the backend for several read-only RESTful 
API endpoints, except for one write-only for statistics. This write-only endpoint is offered over HTTPS POST, 
and is protected with an API key and an [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) signature code.

So, how do we keep these "secrets" (API key, HMAC code, server URL...)? Rooted/jailbroken smartphones, allow access to the 
device internal storage and the retrieval of application binaries is possible... 
(**.ipa** and **.apk**, for iOS and Android respectively). A technically and driven individual could deconstruct the binary 
and dig out exploitable API keys, tokens, especially if they are injected via a CI pipeline and stored internally in clear text.

What can we do? Luckily for us, there is a solution for this which is acknowledged by OWASP: a cross-platform
high-level cryptographic library called **[Themis](https://www.cossacklabs.com/themis/)**. Let's start with Android and then iOS.

## Android

On Android, Gradle compiles the application. To safely prevent a secret from being ever committed to version control
systems (VCS) e.g., GitHub, the recommended strategy is to declare these within **yourUser** directory:

> - Mac/Linux: /Users/**yourUser**/.gradle/gradle.properties
> - Windows: C:\Users\\**yourUser**\\.gradle\gradle.properties

### Keep your secrets in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties

```properties
secret1=hk5j43hk5jh34k5jh345kj34h5kjg345kjg34k5jg3kj45
secret2=kj3h45kj3h4k5hjg34l√∂23hl423lk4h23lk4h23g4kl1k2h3
secretUrl=https://hacker-honeypot.fi
```

The benefit of this approach is that such variables will be available to any project that uses Gradle we may be working
on for our local machine, and there is no risk of having this gradle.properties committed to VCS. This allows you to 
compile, test and deploy the app to a development unit or environment without relying on a third-party source for the 
keys or tokens. Reading the values is as simple as reading them as a Gradle property and using them as we wish.

### App module build.gradle configuration

To support both local deployments, and CI/CD deployments, create a tiny utility
Groovy function before the **android** code block:

```groovy
String getValue(String key) {
    return project.findProperty(key) ? System.getenv(key) : ""
}

android {
  //...
}
```

Then inside the **defaultConfig** code block, we retrieve these values:

```groovy
defaultConfig {
  //...
  buildConfigField "String", "SECRET_1", "\"${getValue("secret1")}\""
  buildConfigField "String", "SECRET_2", "\"${getValue("secret2")}\""
  buildConfigField "String", "SECRET_URL", "\"${getValue("secretUrl")}\""
}
```

Now our "secrets" are available in Kotlin/Java from the Gradle generated BuildConfig object for our app module.
Doing this will prevent us from committing the secrets to VCS, but doesn't protect the secrets from being in the clear
inside the binary üò±

### Using Themis üîê

Let's start by adding Themis as a project dependency, by editing **build.gradle** inside the app module:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.cossacklabs.com:themis:0.13.1'
}
```

Themis encrypts and decrypts in runtime our secrets using an encryption key. So we'll an encryption key into our
user's gradle.properties file:

```groovy
xpto=3hgjkh6g23jlhg65hj345g6kjh3g456uhyjg
```

and then in the application build.gradle, in the defaultConfig block:

```groovy
defaultConfig {
  //...
  buildConfigField "String", "SECRET_1", "\"${getSecret("secret1")}\""
  buildConfigField "String", "SECRET_2", "\"${getSecret("secret2")}\""
  buildConfigField "String", "SECRET_URL", "\"${getSecret("secretUrl")}\""
  buildConfigField "String", "XPTO", "\"${getSecret("xpto")}\""
}
```

#### Obfuscating the encryption key

This encryption key will then be manipulated in runtime and used to encode/decode the secrets. We start by creating an 
encryption key obfuscation function. It is good practice naming this function as something 
that would make it harder to identify in deconstructed binaries (in this example, **crashIt()**) so be creative here!

```kotlin
private fun crashIt() : ByteArray {
    val rawKey = buildString(5) {
        append(byteArrayOf(0x11, 0x07, 0x10).toBase64())
        append(BuildConfig.XPTO)
        append("87bvc765bds876fg87sfd6g876309480")
    }
    return rawKey.toByteArray()
}
```

#### Creating encoded versions of the secrets

Then we create an encoding function to encrypt the original keys as a Base64 string - **be creative here and call it something else**!:

```kotlin
fun String.encode(): String {
    val encodingKey = crashIt()
    val cell = SecureCell.SealWithKey(encodingKey)
    val protected = cell.encrypt(this.toByteArray())
    return Base64.encodeToString(protected, Base64.NO_WRAP)
}
```

We can then replace the secrets in our CI/CD pipeline with these encoded Base64 strings. This means that even the CI/CD
will not know what the secrets are! The only key that is on the CI/CD is the encryption key. Because we are obfuscating
the encryption key in runtime as well, even if someone found the encryption key, they would still need to find what 
runtime operations we do to it in order to restore the real encryption key.

#### Decoding the encoded versions of the secrets

To decode the encrypted Base64 strings, we then need a function to restore the original secret in runtime - **be creative here and call it something else**:

```kotlin
fun String.decode(): String? {
    val encodingKey = crashIt()
    val cell = SecureCell.SealWithKey(encodingKey)
    return try {
        val decoded = Base64.decode(this, Base64.NO_WRAP)
        val unprotected = cell.decrypt(decoded)
        val decrypted = String(unprotected)
        decrypted
    } catch (error: SecureCellException) {
        Timber.d("Failed to decrypt")
        null
    }
}
```

Now we can use the decode() function on the Base64 string to restore in runtime the original value:

```kotlin
val endpoint = BuildConfig.SECRET_URL.decode()
```

This whole process should make it very time consuming to dig out all the steps required to restore your secrets. Using
code obfuscation on top of this, and recreating the encryption key and restoring the secrets makes this task as hard as finding a needle
in a haystack.

# Closing thoughts

Is Themis a 100%-guarantee in keeping secrets away from preying eyes? Unfortunately, no. According to the documentation,
on its own, Themis addresses 90% of the exploits surrounding safeguarding secret encryption and decryption. Those remaining 10% 
often fall onto external factors that can and do compromise your application security, e.g., the backend or the CI/CD itself may be compromised, 
or simply human-error: one may commit the secrets to VCS. Themis is no silver-bullet to security, but it is better than providing
secrets in the clear on an application binary.
