Developer survey has now become a tradition here at Solita. Every two years we survey our developer-minded people regarding what technologies and practices we use in our every-day work. The first survey was conducted in 2016 and you can find a blog post about those results in [our previous blog post](https://dev.solita.fi/java/2016/05/13/Developers-love-spaces.html) and then in 2018 [(blog post in Finnish)](https://www.solita.fi/blogit/development-teknologiakartoitus/). This year we once again took a loot at the survey and came up with a total of 27 questions that would give us interesting insight into what we use, what we like and what could be big in the future. Comparing these results to the previous ones can also give us some information on trends - what technologies are increasing in use and what are in decline?

## Languages we use
## Languages we like
## Languages we would like to use

## Frontend frameworks
## Backend frameworks

## Platforms?

## IDEs
## Operating Systems

## Trends

Usage of cloud platforms is on the rise and that has an impact on lots of things. For example, Jenkins was still the most used CI/CD solution, but its usage had dropped quite significantly and the usage of the solutions provided by the cloud platforms, such as Code* tools in AWS were up. Same could be said about infrastructure-as-code tools: Ansible was still the most used, but its usage had dropped a lot and AWS CDK, Terraform etc. had a lot more usage now.

## Conclusion
