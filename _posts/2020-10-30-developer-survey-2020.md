Developer survey has now become a tradition here at Solita. Every two years we survey our developer-minded people regarding what technologies and practices we use in our every-day work. The first survey was conducted in 2016 and you can find a blog post about those results in [our previous blog post](https://dev.solita.fi/java/2016/05/13/Developers-love-spaces.html) and then in 2018 [(blog post in Finnish)](https://www.solita.fi/blogit/development-teknologiakartoitus/). This year we once again took a loot at the survey and came up with a total of 27 questions that would give us interesting insight into what we use, what we like and what could be big in the future. Comparing these results to the previous ones can also give us some information on trends - what technologies are increasing in use and what are in decline?

## Languages we use

## Platforms?

## IDEs

A new question this year asked what IDEs or editors we use. Most people use several, perhaps based on what languages they are working with currently. Of course then there are also those who only use one (emacs people wouldn't probably want to leave it for any task they need to do).

Most popular one was IntelliJ Idea and other IDEs based on it. Idea is definitely very liked for Java work and Cursive for Clojure and Android Studio for Android app development are much used too. Visual Studio Code has gathered a huge following in a relatively short time and it's no surprise being used a lot among our developers too, considering that [StackOverflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools) had it as the most popular editor.

## Operating Systems

## Trends

Usage of cloud platforms is on the rise and that has an impact on lots of things. For example, Jenkins was still the most used CI/CD solution, but its usage had dropped quite significantly and the usage of the solutions provided by the cloud platforms, such as Code* tools in AWS were up. Same could be said about infrastructure-as-code tools: Ansible was still the most used, but its usage had dropped a lot and AWS CDK, Terraform etc. had a lot more usage now.

## Conclusion
