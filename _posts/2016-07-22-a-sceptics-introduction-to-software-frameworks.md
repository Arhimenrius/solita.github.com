Choosing libraries can be difficult.  
Frameworks try to help with this and with
how to construct code, by telling how your code should be implemented
and what it should do to plug into existing services.

*We want to have the best available tooling at hand.
A framework might tell what to do in a spot of uncertainty.*

*It simplifies some things.*

*On the other hand, frameworks usually don't help with specific business requirements.
Sometimes they get on your way in a major way.*

![Frameworks - 4](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-4.png)
*By and by we realise that there are many kinds of feelings to
arise from reading or debugging framework based code.*

*Frameworks don't magically create happy developers nor correct solutions.
They do what they were specifically designed for, and that might be
a surprisingly hazy thing.*

![Frameworks - 6](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-6.png)
*Understanding is a necessary part of framework adaptation. The inner
details are sometimes crappy or boring.*

![Frameworks - 7](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-7.png)
*Sometimes a framework saves your day. Often it just frustrates.  
Why does it hide those things that you would specifically want to control?
Like, covering an underlying API with its own ad hoc crap...*

*The extreme sceptic claims that all frameworks are silver bullets,
and destined to fail you - or somebody else.  It's in their nature
to fail one that is not very careful.*
