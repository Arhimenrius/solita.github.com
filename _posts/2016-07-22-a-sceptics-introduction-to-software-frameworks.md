Choosing libraries can be difficult.  
Frameworks try to help with this and with
how to construct code, by telling how your code should be implemented
and what it should do to plug into existing services.

*We want to have the best available tooling at hand.
If uncertain, a framework might tell what to do.*

![Frameworks - 2](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-2.png)
*It simplifies some things.*

![Frameworks - 3](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-3.png)
*On the other hand frameworks usually don't help with specific business requirements.
Sometimes they might also get on the way.*

![Frameworks - 4](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-4.png)
*By and by you realise that there are many kinds of feelings that
arise from reading and debugging framework based code.*

![Frameworks - 5](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-5.png)
*Frameworks don't magically create happy developers and correct solutions.
They do what they were specifically designed for.*

![Frameworks - 6](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-6.png)
*Understanding is a necessary part of framework adaptation. The inner
details of them are sometimes crappy or boring.*

![Frameworks - 7](/img/a-sceptics-introduction-to-software-frameworks/fr-7.png)
*Sometimes a framework saves your day. Often it just frustrates.  
Why does it hide those things that you would specifically want to control?
Like, covering an underlying API with its own ad hoc crap...*

*All silver bullets eventually fall to the ground.*
