A group of 5 Clojure enthusiasts from Solita visited the Clojure eXchange conference in London on december 3rd and 4th.

The conference was organized by Skills Matter at Codenode.
[Signal](https://skillsmatter.com/partners/698-signal-media) was kind enough to sponsor the conference to avoid lack of conference t-shirt.
There weren't any other sponsor but the conference itself was organized in a very professional manner.

The talks were very pragmatic, there were many experience reports on how people had solved and used Clojure in actual work.
The focus was in pragmatism but it was neat to see the continued tradition of having more abstract tar pits explored as well ;)

## Day 1

In the welcoming ceremony to get people awake, the organizers asked everyone to stand up and sit down by their years of use of Clojure.
More than half of the participants have used Clojure over 3 years.s
When we got to 10 years, only Christophe Grand was standing :).
This continues to state that Clojure is a mature languge and is in production use in many companies.

### Keynote: The Spirit of Clojure

Karsten Schmidt kicked off the conference with a keynote filled with visual programmatic art.

Karsten has no fear on diving into new languages while solving problems in unfamiliar areas, reading research papers, writing programs in literate style and learning new tooling along the way (Emacs!).
This is quite a feat to do :)
Clojure made him feel like a novice again a feeling that resonates well with many in the community.

Karsten is the author of the [Thi-ng](https://github.com/thi-ng) family of libraries, and he showcased many illustrative projects created with it, using formulas like De Jong attractors, Hilbert curve, Gyroid formula and many others.
Volumetric visualizations allow sampling the formulas to generate views in different resolution, which allows to not think in polygons.
Karsten had also done data visualization projects and it was neat to see what the visual presentation of the  data tells even without labeling.

He ended with a couple of notes:
One on how people in different language communities share same ideas but use different names (Clojurians seldom mention Sparql bu talk about Datomic, GraphQL is known in Javascript land but not Datomic).
Another on the difficulty of writing performant code in Clojurescript when immutability is the default since one has to write more code to "undo" immutability.

In the latter point, it might be better to write such tight loops in plain Javascript. A runtime that does this for you would probably be a worthy research subject.

The continued effort on Clojure tooling got new powers on the second day, when Bozhidar announced that [Christophe Grand would be joining the nREPL team](ink/to/tweet) in bringing the work explored in Unrepl to Cider (elided collections, client-side injection and sideloading for starters).

## Conclusion

All in all, the ClojureX event was a great one!
None of us had been in ClojureX before and we can fully recommend the event.
We met old friends and got to talk to new people in community.
