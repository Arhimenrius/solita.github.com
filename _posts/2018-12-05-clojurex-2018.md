The conference was organized by Skills Matter at Codenode.
[Signal](https://skillsmatter.com/partners/698-signal-media) was kind enough to sponsor the conference to avoid lack of conference t-shirt.
There weren't any other sponsor but the conference itself was organized in a very professional manner.

## Day 1

In the welcoming ceremony to get people awake, the organizers asked everyone to stand up and sit down by their years of
use of Clojure. More than half of the participants have used Clojure over 3 years. When we got to 10 years, only
Christophe Grand was standing :). This continues to state that Clojure is a mature languge ans is in production is in
many companies


## Day 2
