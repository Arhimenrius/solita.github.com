A group of 5 Clojure enthusiasts from Solita visited the [Clojure eXchange conference in London on December 3rd and 4th](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/10459-clojure-exchange-2018). Clojure eXchange, or ClojureX, was organized for the 8th time now and this year's event was the largest in its history. The conference was single-track and spanned two full days of talks on all things Clojure.

The conference was organized by Skills Matter at Codenode.
[Signal](https://skillsmatter.com/partners/698-signal-media) was kind enough to sponsor the conference to avoid lack of conference t-shirt.
There weren't any other sponsors, but the conference itself was organized in a very professional manner.

The talks were very pragmatic, with many first-hand experiences on solving real world problems with Clojure.
Despite the pragmatic focus, it was neat to see the continued tradition of having some of the more abstract tar pits explored as well ;)

## Day 1

The welcoming ceremony had everyone stand up, and gradually sit down based on how long they had been using Clojure. This revealed us the following facts:

* More than half of the audience had over 3 years of Clojure experience
* Christophe Grand didn't understand the instructions, or claimed the seniority by being the last-man-standing at the 10+ year mark*

This continues to make the case for Clojure's maturity and production viability.

### Keynote: The Spirit of Clojure

Karsten Schmidt kicked off the conference with a keynote filled with visual programmatic art.

![Visual art by Karsten](/img/clojurex-2018/visual-art.jpg)

Karsten has no fear on diving into new languages while solving problems in unfamiliar areas, reading research papers, writing programs in literate style and learning new tooling along the way (Emacs!).
This is quite a feat to do :)
Clojure made him feel like a novice again a feeling that resonates well with many in the community.

Karsten is the author of the [Thi-ng](https://github.com/thi-ng) family of libraries, and he showcased many illustrative projects created with it, using formulas like De Jong attractors, Hilbert curve, Gyroid formula and many others.
Volumetric visualizations allow sampling the formulas to generate views in different resolution, which allows to not think in polygons.
Karsten had also done data visualization projects and it was neat to see what the visual presentation of the  data tells even without labeling.

He ended with a couple of notes:
One on how people in different language communities share same ideas but use different names (Clojurians seldom mention Sparql but talk about Datomic, GraphQL is known in Javascript land but not Datomic).
Another on the difficulty of writing performant code in Clojurescript when immutability is the default since one has to write more code to "undo" immutability.

In the latter point, it might be better to write such tight loops in plain Javascript. A runtime that does this for you would probably be a worthy research subject.

<!-- Tämän voi ottaa pois jos muiden mielestä ei ole hyvä maininta -->
The keynote was interesting but there was quite a big difference between what the title made it sound like it was about and what the talk itself ended up being.

### Polymorphism à la Clojure: Functional Object Oriented Programming is not an Oxymoron.

### Data Science in Languages I Don’t Understand

Rob Stanley gave a speech on an implementation of a data driven system for helping farmers all around the world to perform their jobs more efficiently.

A big part of the software was Natural Language Processing, namely, detecting the language and intent of questions sent by farmers using SMS. Implementation consisted of Clojure code for the mathematical models, and a custom EDN formatted DSL for defining patterns that are used for the actual intent prediction.

A general feeling from the speech; Data Scientists are capable of learning and using Clojure (who would have known?), but Data Science in Clojure still requires writing a lot of your own plumping.

### Now you're Speaking my Language! : Building, Maintaining and Using a Patient-Friendly Medical Ontology

### Lightning Talk: Building A Simulation-Based Text Adventure

Peter Westmacott showcased a text-based browser game he's been writing with ClojureScript. Being highly systems-driven akin to titles like Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect, the game runs a simulation of a village and its inhabitants with the aim of modelling social interactions and exploring the concepts of contagious violence and scapegoating. Peter found Clojure's declarative nature, as in open maps and data type literals, a boon for this kind of exploratory simulation work. Other topics such as obscure French philosophical anthropology were also covered, as per usual in a FP conference. Peter also managed to cram a flashy demo in his 10-minute talk, which was much appreciated by the crowd.

### Lightning Talk: Running without an API

This lightning talk presented an application that showed whether a running event in a running community called [ParkRun](https://www.parkrun.com/) was cancelled.
The premise was that the events were announced on the community website, but there was no way to be notified about cancellations other than checking the website listing all the events.
To solve this problem, Gaivile developed a Clojure application to check the status of the events she was interested in. As there was no API to check this information, her application scraped the website and checked the status of the events given as a parameter. The app got its start at London Clojure Dojo, an event where people gather to level up their Clojure skills through practical exercises.

This talk was a good fit for the lightning talk format. The problem statement was easy to explain and understand and there was enough time to present the solution in proper detail.

### Lightning Talk: Making Music With Alda & Edna

Another eloquent speaker, Tristram Oaten demoed [Alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda) and [Edna](https://github.com/oakes/edna), music programming languages for musicians and Clojurians. Tristram started with a brief intro on music theory and moved on to building progressively more complex compositions using an edn syntax. What stood out the most for me was the clever usage of Clojure data structures to express musical concepts such as chords.

### Learning How to Design Automatically Updating AI With Clojure, Kafka and Deeplearning4j

### Are You Writing Java in Clojure?

Erik Assum's talk was one (of many) that we most waited for.

With a background on working on legacy code bases and seeing code which is hard to test or reason about, Erik offered stable advise on how to structure your code to maximize reasonability and testability.

Erik had many good references in his talk, one of which was [Stratified Design](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-15.html#%_idx_1978) from the [SICP book](https://sicpebook.wordpress.com/), how it doesn't necessarily mean a 3-tier architecture.
He also referred to the imperative shell/functional core idea from Gary Bernhardt's [Boundaries talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries).
Make sure to reserve time to go over the references of the talk, they are good quality and well summarized in the talk.

With the help of the [Elements of Clojure book](https://leanpub.com/elementsofclojure) he descibed solid ways to structure code to separate pull/transform/push phases.
He also showed bad code that his boss wrote, how often would you do that in conference? :)

### Speed Bumps Ahead

Alexander Yakushev, who among other things, maintains the [Clojure goes fast!](http://clojure-goes-fast.com/) website, gave a good presentation on performance optimization.

He had an interesting example where he compared the way Clojure compiler uses reflection to plain direct reflection use.
It turned out that in this example, reflection itself wasn't the main offender, but the [Clojure compiler implementation](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/Reflector.java), which is forced to loop over all methods of a class to find one that matches the argument types at runtime.

Even more interestingly, he used a [clj-java-decompiler](https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-java-decompiler), a library which decompiles Clojure code into semi-readable Java, to narrow down to the Clojure compiler implementation that revealed the above fact.

Alexander is the author of many useful libraries found in the [clojure-goes-fast](https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast) Github organization, such as [clj-memory-meter](https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-memory-meter) and [clj-async-profiler](https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-async-profiler).
Another interesting take was writing code that requires more tight control over performance in Java and using [virgil](https://github.com/ztellman/virgil) to still keep the REPL workflow (one doesn't have to quit the repl to recompile/load the Java classes).

### Lightning Talk: Beginners Introduction to Clara Rules

Charlotte Fereday from ThoughtWorks (our Apax sibling) presented [clara-rules](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules), an expert system/rule engine library for managing complex and volatile business logic. Clara takes in a set of forward chaining rules or conditions in form of `if A then B` and then evaluates facts against them. The purpose of a rule engine is to simplify writing business logic into code. While probably overkill for simple cases, the library might work wonders in untangling convoluted conditionals into simple self-contained rules. Unlike enterprise rule systems, Clara offers a lightweight developer-driven approach based on functional programming, with all rules and facts stated out in plain Clojure.

### Lightning Talk: Monitoring Clojure Applications with Prometheus

Joachim Draeger from the sponsor company Signal demonstrated monitoring Clojure microservices via Prometheus, an open source monitoring toolkit originated at Soundcloud. Joachim started by stressing the importance of visibility and metrics in distributed systems and then went on to shed light on the approach they're taking at Signal. The presented solution seemed relatively plug-and-play: pull in a Ring middleware from the Clojure Prometheus client library, configure it to expose a metrics API endpoint and point your Prometheus instance to it. Prometheus then takes care of scraping data from the endpoint and feeding it onto a neat Grafana dashboard. The client library supports all sorts of custom metrics but also includes pre-made solutions for exposing JVM and Ring handler metrics, which seemed very compelling.

### Brewing CIDER: It Starts with an Orchard

Bozhidar, the community's beloved Rockstar had a very entertaining presentation again :)

He continued to make it clear that Cider, although being a Emacs extension (that Rocks!), is backed by a wealth of tooling libraries made by the Clojure community itself.
One not so often mentioned library was [MrAnderson](https://github.com/benedekfazekas/mranderson), which relocates dependencies of the tooling libraries to avoid conflicts with the project using the tooling.

[nREPL](https://nrepl.xyz/nrepl/index.html), the library that enables tooling for Emacs, Vim, VS Code ([Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva), for Calvados distilled from Cider :)) and [many more clients](https://nrepl.xyz/nrepl/usage/clients.html) has a new logo and documentation website.
The [design of nREPL](https://nrepl.xyz/nrepl/design/overview.html) seems solid, a lot can be done with [middleware](https://nrepl.xyz/nrepl/design/middleware.html) (Clojurescript support via Piggieback as an example).
A transit middleware seems to be in the works too.

All this community work happens with marginal funding so help in this regard would be good.

Bozhidar was skeptic that [socket repl](https://clojure.org/reference/repl_and_main#_launching_a_socket_server) and [prepl](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/commit/86a158d0e0718f5c93f9f2bb71e26bc794e7d58e) would be just re-inventing the wheel instead of making a better unified whole.

The continued effort on Clojure tooling got new powers on the second day, when Bozhidar announced that [Christophe Grand would be joining the nREPL team](https://twitter.com/bbatsov/status/1070042820109574144) in bringing the work explored in Unrepl to Cider (elided collections, client-side injection and sideloading for starters).
This could be a direction that unifies the powers of the REPL landscape, a Hegemony as Bozhidar himself put it :)

## Day 2

### Keynote: Zeno and the Tar Pit

Christophe Grand explored a way to escape the [Tar Pit](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf) of the internal state handling in a non-trivial stateful application with the help of Greek philosophers.
He coined the term "Maps Fatigue" to describe the tension of building, converting and maintaining hierarchical in-memory data presentation in programs while coping with changing requirements.

![Maps fatigue](/img/clojurex-2018/maps-fatique.jpg)

The realization is that while Clojure lifted us from imperative programming model of Java with immutable data structures, we still have iterative processing model with seqs, while iteration order is not always meaningful (nor is the intention of iteration order easy to deduce by reading code).
The base of this realization is Christophe's past few years work on stateful stream prosessing and client/server applications.

This set us on a path on exploring databases and Datalog as a solution for the Functional Relational Programming model of the Tar Pit paper.
The talk pointed to a good reading resource, recommended by Rich Hickey himself :) [Foundations of Databases](http://webdam.inria.fr/Alice/).
He covered Datalog syntax, how to make it more readable and how to introduce a [time model](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.html) to be able to make updates and not only queries.

There was a teaser announcement on the final slide of a joint venture with couple of Clojurists called [Tensegritics Consulting](http://www.tensegritics.com/).

### Applying Clojure's Design Principles to its Documentation

### Quick and Easy Testing for Busy Mums (and other Clojure developers)

### Using Duct Framework in Production

Iván Perdomo gave an experience report on using the [Duct](https://github.com/duct-framework/duct) framework. Duct is a modular framework for building server-side applications in Clojure.
They moved a report generation application from Java to Clojure and while adding components to the application, realised the need to manage dependencies between components.

The presentation nicely told that Duct is actually a reference implementation on how to use [Integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant).
There is a tension between a library and a tool that creates a project template with a pre-defined layout set up for a particular set of libraries, since project templates are hard to upgrade.
But even though Duct has a Leiningen template for starting off, it seems to have a good upgradeability via [Modules](https://github.com/duct-framework/duct#overview), which are pure functions that can transform the project configuration.

On the hallway track, it was mentioned that Duct might be arriving to version 1.0.0 with better documentation so stay tuned :)

### Lightning Talk: Some Thoughts about Immutability and its Limits

### Lightning Talk: Reagent and LeafletJS or "Fun with Maps"

This lightning talk was about using Reagent and LeafletJS to add a map component (not the data structure, the geographical map!) to a web page.
Using JavaScript libraries that don't offer existing React components to begin with may not always be easy with Reagent and ClojureScript.
In case of LeafletJS, there are existing React components that could probably be used with Reagent, but even that may have its problems, especially if you are not familiar with JavaScript and React.

The gist of using LeafletJS with Reagent came down to using [form-3 Reagent components](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/blob/master/doc/CreatingReagentComponents.md#form-3-a-class-with-life-cycle-methods).
Most of the time with Reagent it is not needed to define React lifecycle methods yourself.
In the case of using non-React component with state, like LeafletJS is in this case, you need to define them for the component to be initialized and updated correctly.

Due to the fact that this was a lightning talk, we didn't get to hear further details how the implementation went.
Perhaps a little more insight what was needed with LeafletJS in specific could have been brought up.

### Lightning Talk: Fullstack Clojure in the Movie Business

### Lightning Talk: Levelling up Lacinia with Spec

### Clojure Embedded in Music Hardware

### Growing a Product with Clojure: Lessons Learned

### REPtiLe - A Cold Blooded Collaborative REPL

Ray McDermott of [defn podcast](https://soundcloud.com/defn-771544745) gave a very collaborative presentation that got the whole audience involved, although the REPL REPL singing together might have worked better after a beer (or maybe two) :).

This served as an intro to the topic of collaborative coding tools that would serve better the [apropos clojure](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1UxEQuBvfLJgWR5tk_XIXA) screencast, where a set of panelists talk on Clojure and code in a repl.
Tmux had not worked well for them so Ray had created tool that allows multiple users share evaluation of Clojure code from a web browser.

At the end, Ray pulled in Bozhidar and Yehonathan to use REPtiLe in a demo, which turned out a bit cold, but was entertaining anyway.

### Parallel All the Way

Renzo Borgatti, the author of the upcoming [Clojure, The Essential Reference](https://www.manning.com/books/clojure-the-essential-reference) ended the presentations by live-coding demo of a library called [parallel](https://github.com/reborg/parallel), which he has been developing.

Although Clojure has built-in functions for parallel computation (pmap, pvalues, pcalls, reducers/fold, core.async's pipeline), the parallel library seems to have many useful parallelizing functions and forms like `p/let`, `p/slurp` and `p/sort`.

The examples presented showed very fitting use of the library, almost "just add the alias `p/` to regular code".
There's some prior art in libraries like [claypoole](https://github.com/TheClimateCorporation/claypoole), which allows to limit concurrency passing a threadpool for the supported functions.
Nonetheless, there's a fair amount of new useful work offered by the parallel library.

### ClojureX Park Bench Panel

## Conclusion

All in all, the ClojureX event was a great one!
None of us had been in ClojureX before and we can fully recommend the event.
The talks were great and so was the hallway track, which is a sign of active community.

PS. One brief closing note: The Clojurians Slack #clj-commons channel seems quite active after the conference, so if you are interested in the continued maintenance of orphaned libraries, this is a good place to follow.
