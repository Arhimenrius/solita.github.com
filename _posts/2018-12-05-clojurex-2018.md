A group of 5 Clojure enthusiasts from Solita visited the [Clojure eXchange conference in London on December 3rd and 4th](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/10459-clojure-exchange-2018). Clojure eXchange, or ClojureX, was organized for the 8th time now and this year's event was the largest in its history. The conference was single-track and spanned two full days of talks on all things Clojure.

The conference was organized by Skills Matter at Codenode.
[Signal](https://skillsmatter.com/partners/698-signal-media) was kind enough to sponsor the conference to avoid lack of conference t-shirt.
There weren't any other sponsors, but the conference itself was organized in a very professional manner.

The talks were very pragmatic, with many first-hand experiences on solving real world problems with Clojure.
Despite the pragmatic focus, it was neat to see the continued tradition of having some of the more abstract tar pits explored as well ;)

## Day 1

The welcoming ceremony had everyone stand up, and gradually sit down based on how long they had been using Clojure. This revealed us the following facts:

* More than half of the audience had over 3 years of Clojure experience
* Christophe Grand didnt understand the instructions, or claimed the seniority by being the last-man-standing at the 10+ year mark*

This continues to make the case for Clojure's maturity and production viability.

### Keynote: The Spirit of Clojure

Karsten Schmidt kicked off the conference with a keynote filled with visual programmatic art.

![Visual art by Karsten](/img/clojurex-2018/visual-art.jpg)

Karsten has no fear on diving into new languages while solving problems in unfamiliar areas, reading research papers, writing programs in literate style and learning new tooling along the way (Emacs!).
This is quite a feat to do :)
Clojure made him feel like a novice again a feeling that resonates well with many in the community.

Karsten is the author of the [Thi-ng](https://github.com/thi-ng) family of libraries, and he showcased many illustrative projects created with it, using formulas like De Jong attractors, Hilbert curve, Gyroid formula and many others.
Volumetric visualizations allow sampling the formulas to generate views in different resolution, which allows to not think in polygons.
Karsten had also done data visualization projects and it was neat to see what the visual presentation of the  data tells even without labeling.

He ended with a couple of notes:
One on how people in different language communities share same ideas but use different names (Clojurians seldom mention Sparql but talk about Datomic, GraphQL is known in Javascript land but not Datomic).
Another on the difficulty of writing performant code in Clojurescript when immutability is the default since one has to write more code to "undo" immutability.

In the latter point, it might be better to write such tight loops in plain Javascript. A runtime that does this for you would probably be a worthy research subject.

The keynote was interesting but there was quite a big difference between what the title made it sound like it was about and what the talk itself ended up being.

### Brewing CIDER: It Starts with an Orchard

Bozhidar, the community's beloved Rockstar had a very entertaining presentation again :)

He continued to make it clear that Cider, although being a Emacs extension (that Rocks!), is backed by a wealth of tooling libraries made by the Clojure community itself.
One not so often mentioned library was [MrAnderson](https://github.com/benedekfazekas/mranderson), which relocates dependencies of the tooling libraries to avoid conflicts with the project using the tooling.

[nREPL](https://nrepl.xyz/nrepl/index.html), the library that enables tooling for Emacs, Vim, VS Code ([Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva), for Calvados distilled from Cider :)) and [many more clients](https://nrepl.xyz/nrepl/usage/clients.html) has a new logo and documentation website.
The [design of nREPL](https://nrepl.xyz/nrepl/design/overview.html) seems solid, a lot can be done with [middleware](https://nrepl.xyz/nrepl/design/middleware.html) (Clojurescript support via Piggieback as an example).
A transit middleware seems to be in the works too.

All this community work happens with marginal funding so help in this regard would be good.

Bozhidar was skeptic that [socket repl](https://clojure.org/reference/repl_and_main#_launching_a_socket_server) and [prepl](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/commit/86a158d0e0718f5c93f9f2bb71e26bc794e7d58e) would be just re-inventing the wheel instead of making a better unified whole.

The continued effort on Clojure tooling got new powers on the second day, when Bozhidar announced that [Christophe Grand would be joining the nREPL team](https://twitter.com/bbatsov/status/1070042820109574144) in bringing the work explored in Unrepl to Cider (elided collections, client-side injection and sideloading for starters).
This could be a direction that unifies the powers of the REPL landscape, a Hegemony as Bozhidar himself put it :)

## Day 2

### Keynote: Zeno and the Tar Pit

Christophe Grand explored a way to escape the [Tar Pit](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf) of the internal state handling in a non-trivial stateful application with the help of Greek philosophers.
He coined the term "Maps Fatigue" to describe the tension of building, converting and maintaining hierarchical in-memory data presentation in programs while coping with changing requirements.

![Maps fatigue](/img/clojure-2018/maps-fatique.jpg).

The realization is that while Clojure lifted us from imperative programming model of Java with immutable data structures, we still have iterative processing model with seqs, while iteration order is not always meaningful (nor is the intention of iteration order easy to deduce by reading code).
The base of this realization is Christophe's past few years work on stateful stream prosessing and client/server applications.

This set us on a path on exploring databases and Datalog as a solution for the Functional Relational Programming model of the Tar Pit paper.
The talk pointed to a good reading resource, recommended by Rich Hickey himself :) [Foundations of Databases](http://webdam.inria.fr/Alice/).
He covered Datalog syntax, how to make it more readable and how to introduce a [time model](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.html) to be able to make updates and not only queries.

There was a teaser announcement on the final slide of a joint venture with couple of Clojurists called [Tensegritics Consulting](http://www.tensegritics.com/).

### Applying Clojure's Design Principles to its Documentation

### Quick and Easy Testing for Busy Mums (and other Clojure developers)

### Using Duct Framework in Production

Iván Perdomo gave an experience report on using the [Duct](https://github.com/duct-framework/duct) framework. Duct is a modular framework for building server-side applications in Clojure.
They moved a report generation application from Java to Clojure and while adding components to the application, realised the need to manage dependencies between components.

The presentation nicely told that Duct is actually a reference implementation on how to use [Integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant).
There is a tension between a library and a tool that creates a project template with a pre-defined layout set up for a particular set of libraries, since project templates are hard to upgrade.
But even though Duct has a Leiningen template for starting off, it seems to have a good upgradeability via [Modules](https://github.com/duct-framework/duct#overview), which are pure functions that can transform the project configuration.

On the hallway track, it was mentioned that Duct might be arriving to version 1.0.0 with better documentation so stay tuned :)

### Lightning Talk: Some Thoughts about Immutability and its Limits

### Lightning Talk: Reagent and LeafletJS or ""Fun with Maps""

This lightning talk was about using Reagent and LeafletJS to add a map component (not the data structure, the geographical map!) to a web page.
Using JavaScript libraries that don't offer existing React components to begin with may not always be easy with Reagent and ClojureScript.
In case of LeafletJS, there are existing React components that could probably be used with Reagent, but even that may have its problems, especially if you are not familiar with JavaScript and React.

The gist of using LeafletJS with Reagent came down to using [form-3 Reagent components](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/blob/master/doc/CreatingReagentComponents.md#form-3-a-class-with-life-cycle-methods).
Most of the time with Reagent it is not needed to define React lifecycle methods yourself.
In the case of using non-React component with state, like LeafletJS is in this case, you need to define them for the component to be initialized and updated correctly.

Due to the fact that this was a lightning talk, we didn't get to hear further details how the implementation went.
Perhaps a little more insight what was needed with LeafletJS in specific could have been brought up.

## Conclusion

All in all, the ClojureX event was a great one!
None of us had been in ClojureX before and we can fully recommend the event.
The talks we great and so was the hallway track, which is a sign of active community.

PS. One brief closing note: The Clojurians Slack #clj-commons channel seems quite active after the conference, so if you'r interested on the continued maintenance of orphaned libraris, this is a good place to follow.
