### In the beginng ###

Solita has been hosting internal (and semi-internal) [Coding Dojo's](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo) for many years now. It has been great fun and and an awesome way to learn new things together.

If you aren't familiar with the concept of Coding Dojo's it basicly goes like this:

{% highlight java %}
Set<Programmers> coders = gatherPeople();
while (beerLasts && eyesStayOpen) {
	tryToResolveChallengeBrilliantly(coders);
}
representSolutions(coders);
{% endhighlight %}

If you still don't know what Coding Dojo is about take a look at the [this](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo)

### So what is this Codecamp you are talking about? ###

[Codecamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Camp) could be simplified as an extended Coding Dojo. The main principles are the same; programming challenge, bunch of programmers having fun, beer, food, relaxing. But where Coding Dojo is a fun way to spend a evening, Codecamp is great way to spend a day. 

What you need for your own Codecamp? Basicly some kind of idea of an challenge. It could be related to a subject ([Justin Bieber](www.justinbiebermusic.com), [Ponies](www.hasbro.com/mylittlepony) or maybe technology ([Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck), [Fortran](http://www.fortran.com/), [COBOL](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/COBOL.html)). Just make sure the idea is something will be exciting for all the people taking part in the Codecamp.

So you got a brilliant idea and people wanting to participate? Well next you need to able to host it. I would suggest you pick a venue that is not affliatiated with you organisation. For example we rented a cabin in the woods. It helps different the happening from work(/studies) and participants can relax.

The next thing you need is basic infrastracture for the challenge. You probably need atleast these:

* Workstations 
	* Chairs
	* Tables
	* Remember team work is gold, so plan these accordingly!
* Network stuff
	* Internet (meaning somekind of uplink)
	* DHCP/DNS -services
	* Switches, WLAN AP's etc.	
* Revision control system ([git](http://git-scm.com/) etc.)

...and most likely also these:

* Projector (for showing those awesome softwares people built)
* Post-Its's, Pens, Drawing boards
* Spare machines, mouses etc. 

Remember to test the IT stuff beforehand, especially if you took my advice and are planning to host the event in a cabin or otherwise unfamiliar place. Our network stuff looked like this :

Also make sure you have enough food and [drinks](http://xkcd.com/323/) so that everyone can focus 100% on the task on hand. While energy drinks and snacks are nice, dont forget about real food either.

### Solita Codecamp 2012: Success delivered. Well, atleast 95% success ###

Official Codecamp protector and the teams next to him

Solita had an internal Solita Camp 16-11-2012 @ Middle-of-nowhere. It was a huge success (in my mind, but also judging from the feedback we got). Our idea for the Codecamp was to learn more about the dozens of Javascript libraries there.

We arrived at Codecamp HQ at 10 am and started setting up chairs, network etc. To our disappoiment the network service in that area was awful for DNA and Sonera. And of course all of our dongles and loadbalanging hardware was dependant on those operators. Luckily some people had their private phones with them that were equipped with Saunalahti/Elisa and we could build some hotspots from those. 

Other than the idea about using Javascript based/somehow-related technologies we really made no restrictions on what to use or what to do. Some of us made games, some of us made simulators and somebody visualized data to a nice graphical form.We randomly picked the subject for the projects by looking through that day's Twitter trends and voted a winner from them. You can actually see the the different candidates in the previous picture. The winner was "Global warming".

We quickly started planning our projects.
