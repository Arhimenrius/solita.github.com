excerpt: Codecamps are a great way to learn new things and also sosialize with your mates. Solita hosted it's first internal Codecamp november 2012 and it was a great success!

### In the beginng ###

Solita has been hosting internal (and semi-internal) [Coding Dojo's](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo) for many years now. It has been great fun and and an awesome way to learn new things together.

If you aren't familiar with the concept of Coding Dojo's it basicly goes like this:

{% highlight java %}
Set<Programmers> coders = gatherPeople();
while (beerLasts && eyesStayOpen) {
	tryToResolveChallengeBrilliantly(coders);
}
representSolutions(coders);
{% endhighlight %}

If you still don't know what Coding Dojo is about take a look at the [this](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo)

### So what is this Codecamp you are talking about? ###

[Codecamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Camp) could be simplified as an extended Coding Dojo. The main principles are the same; programming challenge, bunch of programmers having fun, beer, food, relaxing. But where Coding Dojo is a fun way to spend a evening, Codecamp is great way to spend a day. 

What you need for your own Codecamp? Basicly some kind of idea of an challenge. It could be related to a subject ([Justin Bieber](http://www.justinbiebermusic.com), [Ponies](http://www.hasbro.com/mylittlepony) or maybe technology ([Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck), [Fortran](http://www.fortran.com/), [COBOL](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/COBOL.html)). Just make sure the idea is something will be exciting for all the people taking part in the Codecamp.

So you got a brilliant idea and people wanting to participate? Well next you need to able to host it. I would suggest you pick a venue that is not affliatiated with you organisation. For example we rented a cabin in the woods. It helps different the happening from work(/studies) and participants can relax.

The next thing you need is basic infrastracture for the challenge. You probably need atleast these:

* Workstations 
	* Chairs
	* Tables
	* Remember team work is gold, so plan these accordingly!
* Network stuff
	* Internet (meaning somekind of uplink)
	* DHCP/DNS -services
	* Switches, WLAN AP's etc.	
* Revision control system ([git](http://git-scm.com/) etc.)

...and most likely also these:

* Projector (for showing those awesome softwares people built)
* Post-Its's, Pens, Drawing boards
* Spare machines, mouses etc. 

Remember to test the IT stuff beforehand, especially if you took my advice and are planning to host the event in a cabin or otherwise unfamiliar place. Our network stuff looked like this :

Also make sure you have enough food and [drinks](http://xkcd.com/323/) so that everyone can focus 100% on the task on hand. While energy drinks and snacks are nice, dont forget about real food either.

### Solita Codecamp 2012: Success delivered. Well, atleast 95% success ###

Official Codecamp protector and the teams next to him

Solita had an internal Solita Camp 16-11-2012 @ Middle-of-nowhere. It was a huge success (in my mind, but also judging from the feedback we got). Our idea for the Codecamp was to learn more about the dozens of Javascript libraries there.

We arrived at Codecamp HQ at 10 am and started setting up chairs, network etc. To our disappoiment the network service in that area was awful for DNA and Sonera. And of course all of our dongles and loadbalanging hardware was dependant on those operators. Luckily some people had their private phones with them that were equipped with Saunalahti/Elisa and we could build some hotspots from those. 

Other than the idea about using Javascript based/somehow-related technologies we really made no restrictions on what to use or what to do. Some of us made games, some of us made simulators and somebody visualized data to a nice graphical form.We randomly picked the subject for the projects by looking through that day's Twitter trends and voted a winner from them. You can actually see the the different candidates in the previous picture. The winner was "Global warming".

After setting up the necessities we divided in to groups of three or four people. We quickly started planning our projects.Ideas were flowing and like I said the projects were all quite different in their nature. ,

We developed our projects in to 7 pm or something like that and weirdly enough took almost no breaks. Quick lunch in the middle of the day and straight on till the evening. Everybody was really in to the projects and were trying their best. The level of communication even between teams was awesome, probably some thanks to our internet problems.

We used revision control system of course. Our original plan was to use private Gitlab because we kinda knew that we couldn't rely on the internet. Some of use how were lucky enough to have Elisa as their operator used Github, but most of the projects used the private Gitlab onsite. After the Codecamp all of the projects were transferred (naturally) to Github.

Some of the technologies used :

* [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)
* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)
* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
* ..and others

After we were semi-happy with our little lovechilds we started to review them on the screen. It was awesome too se what the teams came up and also to have some laughs on our not-so-serious background stories for the projects. 

We decided to give out awards in two categories: technological awesomeness and artisticality. The award for the technological categore was [Raspberry Pi's](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) and the other awards can be seen in the next picture.

Timo didn't even actually win in the category but who cares!

After the reviewing part was time for some sauna and booze. 

### Sum it up ###

All in all the event was a great success in terms of learning and working together. Although we all work for the same company most of us aren't working together on the same project in "real life". Getting to know each other skills in a practical happening like this is really helpful, because now you know how good the others guy are and can ask them for help.
