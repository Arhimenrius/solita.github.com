Code reviews are something we all have been involved, and what we do continuously in our projects. We might have contradictory feelings about them. Often they feel like just bureaucracy that is required by a manager. Sometimes we want someone to give us feedback on our code. When we see poor code, we might think that we should've reviewed the code better. In this blog post I will explain why code reviews are important, even more important than programming itself. I will also give motivation to do code reviews now, not after few days. Some practical tips will be also given to make reviewing easier.
