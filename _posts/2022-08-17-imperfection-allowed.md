Ever feel like everyone except you manages to navigate the choppy waters of building and maintaining a career in professional software development? These high achievers sail from strength to strength, propelled along by a clear map, a well-calibrated compass and ample reserves of knowledge, skills and self-confidence. Whereas you're stuck on a rocky shore, unsure of where exactly you are and where you should be going. Scared that you don't have what it takes to reach the high seas.

Well, this was me a while back. I'd worked as a software developer for well over a decade, and to begin with things had progressed nicely. I joined a respectable company with interesting, societally impactful projects. I learnt various technologies (any MOSS 2007 survivors out there?), continued studying alongside work and enjoyed the many wonderful aspects of the dev profession.

## Downward spirals

However, gradually my outlook became rockier. I switched jobs. I didn't dare to apply to the best-of-class companies or the more challenging positions, because I've always had a tendency towards [impostor syndrome](https://dev.solita.fi/2021/02/12/generalist-specialization-and-the-impostor-syndrome.html). I had not built strong professional networks and whatever networks I had, I didn't dare utilize. Any kind of self-promotion felt extremely alien.

Years went by and I ended up stalling professionally, which in this industry means going backwards. I was entangled in legacy systems, doing odd jobs and patchy maintenance. Working in a tiny dev team, which meant limited possibilities for collegial learning and support. Hello, [boreout](https://dev.solita.fi/2022/02/21/is-it-better-to-burn-out-than-fade-away.html)! I was deeply anxious I'd missed the up-to-date developer boat so completely I'd never climb back aboard.

## Breaking free from the tangle

But behold! Last year I saw the light: things had to change. I applied to a few dev positions, again with zero skills in network utilization, social media presence, hobby project showcasing or any of the supposed must-dos in today's recruitment market. In a fit of bravery, I also sent an application to Solita, because I'd long had a positive image of the company. Moreover, I'd seen some Solita consultants in action and been wowed by their easy-going professionalism.

Despite my disbelief, I ended up at Solita. I was honest right from the start concerning my imperfections, most notably the need for catching up regarding modern development. But it was all okay! Together we would find ways to get me going again in an environment that consciously invests in [psychological safety](https://www.solita.fi/en/blogs/feeling-safe-at-work-is-good-for-people-and-the-business/).

## Rediscovering professional growth

I got to join a project with extremely talented, helpful colleagues and super nice customers. There's a ton to learn, it takes grit and is not always easy or pleasant. I keep having to tell myself imperfection is still okay, and I can only do my best. Fortunately, Solita offers a wide range of [avenues for personal and professional growth](https://www.solita.fi/en/room-to-grow/), and they are not only meant for people starting out in IT. For instance, I'm taking part in a [mentoring program](https://www.solita.fi/en/blogs/mentoring-at-solita-how-can-mentoring-support-individual-growth/), where I get to benefit from the expertise of a senior colleague in exploring my work practices and competences.

Besides the project team(s), at Solita employees also have the support of a separate administrative team, and what a wonderfully [diverse bunch we are](https://www.solita.fi/en/blogs/solita-culture-part-1-come-as-you-are/)! I've found this home base valuable and have been touched by my People Leads' caring attitude. I feel like a whole person also at work - not just a [resource in an Excel file](https://dev.solita.fi/2017/03/24/being-a-software-designer-at-solita.html). To boost this cozy feeling, there are various events on team and company level, and anyone is free to set up hobby events that range from flower wreath binding to ice swimming. If you feel like your dev career needs some reviving, too, why not join the Solita crew?
