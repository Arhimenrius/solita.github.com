#Working title
_Puheenvuoroja on yhteensä 16, eli viidelle kirjoittajalle se on noin 3 per naama. Pistäkää oma nimi puheenvuoron alle. Jos VOITTE kirjoittaa aiheesta, mutta ette ehdottomasti halua, niin pistäkää kuitenkin nimi alle. Kaikistahan näistä kuitenkin pitää kirjoittaa_

_Jos ette ole kirjoittaneet ennen blogiin, lisätkää `_config.yml` teidän author tietonne. Päivittäkää tiedoston alussa olevaan metatietoon nimenne._

_Lyhyt kappale tai kaksi per puheenvuoro. Koitetaan kuvata puheenvuoron sisältö sillä tavalla, että lukija ymmärtää, haluaako hän katsoa videoinnin. Jos teillä on hyviä kuvia, niin liittäkää niitä tähän. Karsitaan sitten lopuksi ylimääräiset kuvat pois._

EuroClojure 2016 was held in Bratislava, Slovakia on the 25th and 26th of October. Solita was only not one of the sponsors of the event, but also sent the five of us to attend. EuroClojure did not disappoint, and was full of interesting talks. This blog post is an overview of the presentations, which will hopefully help you decide which ones you'll want to eventually watch on Youtube.

###Now what? David Nolen
###Clojure is Not Afraid of the GPU, Dragan Djuric
Juhana
###Living with spec, Simon Belak
###A tale of Clojurescript in Production at a Payment Company, Jean-Louis Giordano
This presentation was an experience report on moving from Ruby to ClojureScript. Jean-Louis talked about what their experience at Zimpler was like, why they chose ClojureScript, and how they evolved their tooling and workflow as they learned more about the Clojure ecosystem. These kinds of talks are helpful in bringing more people into Clojure.

One interesting angle this talk had was the experience of the designers at Zimpler. At first they used [Enfocus](https://github.com/ckirkendall/enfocus), but to better integrate the designers' and developers' workflows they moved on to [Kioo](https://github.com/ckirkendall/kioo). Currently they're experimenting with having their designers write React component's in JSX. Like Jean-Louis said, a designer doesn't become a better designer by learning ClojureScript, so they have no incentive to do so - but the team still has to create the best possible workflow.
###Clojure is a Foreign Country: Combining Datomic with Scala, Peter Brachwitz
###Machine Learning with Clojure and Apache Spark, Eric Weinstein
###ClojureBridge Europe, Malwine Gier & Arne Brassuer
ClojureBridge is a community that aims to increase diversity within the broader Clojure community, and to date the most popular way to achieve that goal has been organising programming workshops for women. In fact, Solita has been a part of such workshops in Helsinki, Tampere, and Oulu!

**Tähän vielä jatkoa**
###GeoRepl - Interactive Geometry with Clojure, Thomas Neuhalfen

###Priority Search Queues: 1.5 dimensional Tree Search, Michal Marczyk
Juhana
###Communicating Risk Reactively, Mike Pearson

###Automating Resilience Testing with Clojure and Docker, Daniel Lebrero
Kimmo
###Bare Metal Clojure with clojure.spec, Michael Reitzenstein
Juhana
###Making Machines that Make Music, Srihari Sriraman
###Live-coding Mathematics: Your First Clojure Proof, Frederic Peschanski

This presentation continued the tradition of live-coding logic systems, resembling last year's &#x3bc;Kanren talk by
Bodil Stokke. Like Bodil, Frederic used the power of Emacs to conduct his live presentation :). He presented
[LaTTe (a Laboratory for Type Theory experiments)](https://github.com/latte-central/LaTTe), a proof assistant library
written interily in Cloure, which makes it only a vector of [latte "0.3.7-SNAPSHOT"] away from your project.clj. He
showed how in LaTTE one can express logic from the Aristotle's reasoning of Socrates being mortal to injectivity. The
presentation itself is available as a Leiningen project at https://github.com/latte-central/latte-euroclojure-2016, so
trying it out while watching the video of the presentation might make for a good learning :)

###A Case Study of Natural Language Processing in Clojure, Daniel Janus

Having seen a presentation about machine learning already made the angle of this talk curious. Daniel took a very
detailed take on what it took to process a corpus of the Polish Parliamentary Proceedings. The corpus itself is a
website, which requires scraping. Although this might seem easy at first, this turns out to be more complicated, since
the site has navigation designed for humans, which the scraper program has to follow. This was accomplished with a
library called [Skyscraper](https://github.com/nathell/skyscraper), offering ways to specify traversal, capturing and
caching of the scraping process. 

When it comes to actual NLP, one can say only this:

![Polish is hard](/img/euroclojure-2016/polish-is-hard.jpg)

Fortunately there exists [stemming libraries for Polish](https://github.com/morfologik/morfologik-stemming) (Finns have [Voikko](http://voikko.puimula.org) for that) that the [Smyrna](https://github.com/nathell/smyrna) application uses. Smyrna itself is the app for searching the corpus data with a ClojureScript UI made with re-frame. One neat thing is that reading of the compressed corpus data is quite low-level endeavour and inner loops of the implementation make use of the lesser known `:volatile-mutable` metadata.

As to why not use Elastic/Solr, the author granted a NIH syndrome, but some of which is required for going deep :)

###Genetic Programming with clojure.spec, Carin Meier

The keynote speaker was introduced by David Nolen, describing his colleague as someone who constantly applies new things
in whatever she does. Caren used the division coined by the mathematician
David Mumford to programmers: Explorers, Alchemists, Wrestlers and Detectives. Carin identifies herself as an Alchimist, and she conducted quite an alchemy with clojure.spec :) First one was using a genetic algorithm to generate a spec for a piece of data, by scoring specs on how much of data they could consume without error and then mutating, breeding and selecting evolution after another. But wait, the result can also generate data, for which a spec could be generated...

![Mind blown](/img/euroclojure-2016/mind-blown.jpg)

Next alchemy experiment took ideas from the MIT Codepage project for self-healing code. Clojure.spec was used to find a substitute for a function that throws an error (identifying the function from stack frames). The mechanics seemed a bit simpler than with the evolution experiment, but the neat thing was that dynamism of Clojure offers to override the misbehaving function.

The main theme of EuroClojure 2016 seemed to be on clojure.spec, and Carin's talk ended with a challenge for all the other tribes to go forth and use it for a win :)
