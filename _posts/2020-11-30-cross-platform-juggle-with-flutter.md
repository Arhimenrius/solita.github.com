title: Cross-Platform Juggle with Flutter
author: denzilferreira
excerpt: >
  To create a cross-platform mobile application, efficiently, and still support native libraries and quirks is usually tasked to two distinct teams, working in tandem to produce the same experience for all users. What if I told you that there is a robust platform in town that offers this and much more to create an app in record time? This is what I learned with Flutter.

# Fitting all the molds: Flutter <3 Android & iPhone

My first interaction with Android was with the very first device during the summer of 2006. As a device, the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1 in the US) Android phones was revolutionary, especially if you were coming from other feature phones (Nokia, Blackberry, Motorola). Android devices promised to bring into someone's pocket a tiny "laptop" that also did phone calls. The keyboard made it easy to relate. However, when Apple announced the iPhone in January 2007, everything changed: touch and swipes are here to stay.

There is no denying smartphones have evolved significantly since then. The same can be said about the operating system that power Android and iOS devices. With each iteration, the design framework also evolved, and so did the programming language used to create increasingly beautiful and engaging applications.

# Business Challenge: Finding "Unicorns"

It's EXTREMELY rare to find someone who has equal experience with both Android & iOS development. It takes a significant amount of hands-on development to truly understand the inner workings of both platforms.

# Pursuit of the Holy Grail: Cross-platform Frameworks

Several platforms have emerged to solve this problem: Xamarin, React Native are the most popular ones.

# How is Flutter different from Xamarin, React Native, ...?

## UI as Code

## Performance

## Native compiled applications
