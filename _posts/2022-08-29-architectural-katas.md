Continuous learning is part of [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) way of working. Solita developers experimented using the Architectural Katas -exercise to learn software architecture designing skills together. This is a brief summary of the experiences of one such session.

(Thanks to Heikki Hämäläinen for promoting the Architectural Katas at Solita!)

## Architectural Katas

### What

The Software Architecture Katas is a method to learn and share knowledge on how to design software architecture and software.
It is a lightweight group exercise which requires from little to no preparation work.

### Why

Software architecture design work is a practice which for most developers and architects is not done continuously.

Also, software architecture design work is often an amendment to an already existing design.

How can one learn and improve a skill if they get to practice it only seldom?

Here's where Architecture Katas comes to the rescue.

### How

The Software Architecture Katas method is explained well by e.g.[http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas](http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas/). Do check that out for more details, it is a quick read.

In short:

- Select an organizer 

- Select one Architectural Kata (i.e., scenario) as the exercise subject
  - [List](http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas/list.html) of katas or a [random](http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas/random.html) kata
- Select one person to play the role of a customer
  - The customer familiarizes oneself beforehand with the selected Kata
- Organize a meeting, for example 2 - 2,5h in total
  - A face-to-face meeting is most effective, but remote via shared screen is possible
  - Set time limits depending on the number of groups, for example:
    - 15 minutes for introduction and forming groups
    - 45 - 60 minutes for group work
    - 30 - 60 minutes for presentations and wrap-up
  - Form groups
    - Avoid having current team members in the same group
  - Customer presents the Kata scenario using 1 - 3 slides
    - Teams may ask questions from Customer after the presentation and during the group work
  - Teams move to a suitable place to do the group work using a whiteboard, post-it notes or similar tools.
  - After the group work part is over each group presents their solution and reasoning
    - Other groups may ask questions
    - After the team presentation the other teams do a quick voting round where they vote if the solution is good for the scenario, misses it badly or is something in between (for example: thumbs up, down or side).

## Experiences

### On innovation

In innovation what matters is quantity over quality. This applies to both individual innovation process as well as to group innovation.

In practice this means producing as many ideas as possible - both suitable *and* bad!

That means quantity over quality.

This is important because in innovation the best idea is usually a *synthesis of several alternatives*.

Stopping after the first solution candidate is likely to miss variations which would make it even better. Keep in mind that there are many different approaches and solutions to a problem.

### On Architectural Katas

We found that the Architectural Katas supports innovation and design work as well as sharing knowledge on how to design architectures.

People have different points of view and observations in the exercise scenario. People have different skillsets and experiences. As a result, they consider different problems and sides of requirements and produce different solutions. The same variation applies to solutions produced by teams.

During Architectural Katas innovation and design happens first within a group. Then a second time during then the presentation and discussion part, where the diverse ways to tackle the problems are shared and challenged.

We found that the Architectural Katas exercise is a good way to share skills and knowledge. We found the exercise interesting and enjoyed it. We also intend to have the exercise regularly.

Thoughts on how to carry out the exercise

- If a key skill is required to be included in each group, consider shuffling groups to balance the skills. On the other hand, you may accept this and see how it turns out.
- It is important to form groups so that current team members are not together. This reduces the "doing it like we always do" phenomenon.
- If you have carried out the exercise already a few times and want to create variation, you may try having the Customer overlook mentioning some important quirk or a need. This is what often happens in real life. The constraint should be such that it can be detected when a team asks questions. This will coach the teams the importance of asking questions.
- If you want to practice a specific use-case of a Kata, you may optionally decide an extra constraint or requirement.
  - For example, the constraint could be "technology X cannot/must be used", if you want to focus on practicing designing using a specific set of tools.
