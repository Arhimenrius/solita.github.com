Traditionally video games have handled animations by first drawing animations
frame by frame, starting from old games with two or three frames for moving and
gradually increasing the number of frames in order to make the animations
smoother. Eventually with customers looking for increased realism, developers
and artists started creating animations procedurally rather than using a
pre-drawn set of animations. This enabled creating features like ragdolls,
which have since then become a staple in 3D games. Further development into
procedural animation has enabled making even more immersive games, with
characters placing their hands onto nearby walls when walking.

In an unrelated industry, many similar topics have been already been
researched. How a hand should be positioned in order to touch the wall is
solved by the same math as how a robotic arm should be positioned in order to
drive a screw in. This particular area of math is called _inverse kinematics_,
which asks to what angles a set of joints should be set for a robotic arm to
touch the desired point. This blog post implements a simple algorithm called
_Cyclic Coordinate Descent_ (or CCD) which numerically approximates the joint
angles.

Math
----

CCD approximates the correct joint angles by going over every joint starting
from the "palm" joint and adjusting the joint angle, so that the target point
is located within the line going from the angle to the palm. With a few
iterations, the resulting approximation is pretty good.

We'll be using PyGame for visualizations, which will also take care of most of
the actual math. The only thing we have to think about is what vectors to
rotate.

A quick primer in vector math: In our use case vectors are essentially objects
containing two numbers, `x` length and `y` length. Adding two vectors together
results in a third vector with the `x` and `y` components added together.
Negating `a` vector (or multiplying by -1) results in each component being
negated.

These can be visualized pretty easily. In the following graph, `a`, `b` and `c`
are vectors while `Î±` is the angle between `a` and `b`. If you add `b` and `c`
together, you get `a`. Similarly, if you remove `b` from `a`, you get `c`.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 15px">
<img src="/img/inverse-kinematics-with-python/vectorprimer.png" alt="" />
</div>

With PyGame, these can be easily computed.

```python
from pygame.math import Vector2

a = Vector2(200, -100)
b = Vector2(200, 100)
c = a - b # or Vector2(0, -200)
alpha = a.angle_to(b)
```

Solving the angles
------------------

<div style="display: flex">
<img src="/img/inverse-kinematics-with-python/math5.png" alt="" />
</div>

In this picture, we need to first rotate `a` around `b`, so that the line
between `a` and `b` points towards the target. After that, we need to rotate
`a` and `b` around `c`, so that the line between `a` and `c` points towards the
target.

Let's start off by defining the points and the target. Since we are going to
rotate stuff, let's store the points as relative coordinates and a set of angles.

```python
points = list(map(Vector2, [(100, 100), (200, 100), (300, 100), (400, 100), (500, 100)]))
target = Vector2(450, 300)

rel_points = []
angles = []

for i in range(1, len(points)):
    rel_points.append(points[i] - points[i-1])
    angles.append(0)
```

Let's consider the simple case first. When we are trying to adjust the
`a-b-target` angle, we want to rotate `a` around `b`. Essentially, we want to
change the current angle to 0.

```python
i = len(points)-2 # second-to-last index
endpoint = a
current_point = b

angle = (endpoint-current_point).angle_to(target-current_point)
angles[i] += angle
```

What about the second iteration, when we are rotating `a` and `b` around `c`?

```python
i = len(points)-3 # third-to-last index
endpoint = a - rel_points[len(points)-1] + rel_points[len(points)-1].rotate(angles[i+1])
current_point = b

angle = (endpoint-current_point).angle_to(target-current_point)
angles[i] += angle
```

The code is identical except for calculating the position of the endpoint.
Let's generalize it to a function:

```python
def solve_ik(i, endpoint, target):
    if i < len(points) - 2:
        endpoint = solve_ik(i+1, endpoint, target)
    current_point = points[i]

    angle = (endpoint-current_point).angle_to(target-current_point)
    angles[i] += angle

    return current_point + (endpoint-current_point).rotate(angle)
```

This function recursively goes through the points, starting from the last point
and moving backwards. Every time it updates one angle, it rotates the endpoint around
the just-updated angle.

Rendering
---------

PyGame makes rendering things easy, the drawing code almost looks like
pseudocode. We simply render every point and draw straight lines between them.

```python
def render():
    black = 0, 0, 0
    white = 255, 255, 255

    screen.fill(white)
    for i in range(1, len(points)):
        prev = points[i-1]
        cur = points[i]
        pygame.draw.aaline(screen, black, prev, cur)
    for point in points:
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, black, (int(point[0]), int(point[1])), 5)
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, black, (int(target[0]), int(target[1])), 10)
    pygame.display.flip()
```

Let's wrap the program in a small loop, where we update the point positions
after solving the appropriate angles:

```python
import sys, pygame
pygame.init()

size = width, height = 640, 480
screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size)

while 1:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT: sys.exit()

    solve_ik(0, points[-1], target)

    angle = 0
    for i in range(1, len(points)):
        angle += angles[i-1]
        points[i] = points[i-1] + rel_points[i-1].rotate(angle)

    render()
    pygame.time.wait(int(1000/60))
```

With this code, the angles converge almost instantly to an acceptable range.

Making it better
----------------

Let's do small adjustments to make this look better. Let's make the target move
around so that the angles need to be constantly adjusted, and at the same time
limit the amount a joint can move per frame, so the movement looks more
natural.

Moving the ball around is simple, just move it with constant speed in every
frame and reverse the direction if it hits a wall.

```python
target_speed = Vector2(3, 3)
#...
target += target_speed
if target.x <= 0 or target.x >= width:
    target_speed.x = -target_speed.x
if target.y <= 0 or target.y >= height:
    target_speed.y = -target_speed.y
```

Limiting angular momentum is also pretty simple, just determine the rotation
direction and limit it to some constant.

```
angles[i] += min(max(-3, angle), 3)
```

Summary
-------

Inverse kinematics drive calculations like "How can I make this arm touch this
ball?", while Python and PyGame enable implementing small simulations easily.
These can be further combined with other techniques to create more lifelike
games. For further examples, see [this walking spider
demo](https://twitter.com/CodeerStudio/status/1243708696921808896) and [this

inverse kinematics for procedural animation.
