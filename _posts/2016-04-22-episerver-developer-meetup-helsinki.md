EPiServer had a fine idea to have a meetup for finnish EPiServer developers. Meetup consisted of pizza, beer and presentations. I loved to be present on the meetup and I think that the format was a perfect match to have a cozy atmosphere around the EPiServer topic. Only thing that could be done better next time would be to have more time at the end for the networking! Need for more time usually means that the actual happening has been great success! 

## R.I.P XForms 

Mikko Huilaja from Solita had a hour long presentation about new EPiServer forms.

## Commerce promotion engine 

Quan Mai had a preview peek on the upcomming promotion engine enhancement. If I understood correctly the promotion engine might be included in next Commerce major release. The new system was content-based and it was promised to be a lot faster than the old system. Debugging and extending it seemed to be thought in a good manner. This also means that there is even less need for using Commerce Manager when it could be managed inside CMS. 

## Webhooks

James Stout (the egandalf himself) had a cool presentation about webhooks. With just a few lines of code he showed us how to hook into form post event and push its content through Zapier into google spreadsheets. It looked so easy and so painless I wish I would be as cool magician as egandalf is!

## Cyberaware development with EPiServer 

I had a presentation about secure development.
