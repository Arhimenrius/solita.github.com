DevSec is a culture where developers teach themselves to think like hackers. They take the responsibility of the solution security aiming for more secure future. 

## Why

How often have you heard the words "security has to be thought all the time" or "you just can't add security afterwards"? That is the core of the problematic that the DevSec tries to solve. Who knows what is illegal use for your application if not the developer? It is the developer who should know how to protect his solution against illegal actions. So why not teach them how to test security and how to implement security controls? 

## What

Security is not just knowing the OWASP TOP 10 lits and trying to avoid implementing any of them. Security as a word covers quite a long list of items. 

* Physical security of data center and client machines
* Hardware security
* BIOS security 
* Operating system security
* Application server security
* Language and framework specific security 
* Component security
* Code 
* Monitoring
* Incident & response 
* and more 

Who takes the responsibility of the whole stack? The whole solution security. 

## How

I myself prefer to bind secure development lifecycle model into our project. It dictates that what kind of thinking should be done during the project. There are steps that may need some training like penetration testing. 

## How has it worked

By embracing DevSec a lot of cool things has already happened. Our customers have been pleased when we have brought up things that have security issues. By doing security testing it is likely to find also not just security flaws but also logical inconsistencies in the software. By ordering penetration testing outside of the company you might not get all the ugly functionalities into your reports because security companies are mostly interested on security issues.
