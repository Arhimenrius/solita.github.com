JavaOne is the biggest, the baddest and the meanest Java developer event in the infinite universe. Held once a year in middle of Silicon Valley, it is the place to be. It is an intense week of knowledge, experimentation, and passion. It is a fusing of the greatest minds in the business, and it is a recharge of energy and ideas.

After Oracle acquisition, JavaOne has been held at the same time, at the same location, with Oracle OpenWorld. This means that Moscone Center is full of people who want to buy and sell solutions, and the nearby hotels are filled with passionate developers who want to build things, and break them apart. This typically creates some very interesting lunchtime conversations - when the suits and the t-shirts meet.

There are still more Java developers out there than people living in Finland. We could actually create a formidable nation of our own, if we'd just find a piece of land to claim. But instead of physical place and borders, community of Java developers forms an international, virtual nation. And once a year, a lot of them are in the same place at the same time.

Okay, I think the point was made clear. It's very cool to have the opportunity to attend, even if you have to do a 14 hours of plane travel to attend from Finland. I am expecting to hear some interesting new reveals, hear some cool gossip, and try some nifty new tools and gadgets out with my own hairy hands. Nowdays information is generally available free of charge and more important than finding information is filtering the useful out of the unworthy or harmful. One way to do it is to experiment with it.

As always, it was very difficult to set up my schedule for the upcoming four intense days. There are more than 450 sessions, most on stuff that would be useful to know. I tried to focus on standards, such as Java 9, but got lured by interesting sessions on micro services, and some speakers that I know will be very good. Giving up on the thought of being able to attend all the interesting sessions I would want to, instead I'll be focusing on any hands-on labs first, then prioritize any unique cool sessions with good speakers, and fill the rest with any details on emerging standards. Let's see where that will get me.

Oh, and there's a rebellion going on. It seems that Java community is not trusting Java EE 8 to be released anytime soon, or its contents to be relevant in todays microservice orientated world. So there's a new profile petition, called Java Microprofile, and it's not from Oracle. It's backed by companies like IBM, Red Hat, Tomitribe, Payara, and I will keep my ears open on any updates. You can already tinker around with it.

During this week I will be blogging live from San Francisco, in this same place. Of course due to some time differences there will be some delay anyway. There are some other blogs also radiating some good JavaOne stuff so if you can spare some time during this week, now is great time to spend 15 minutes everyday and keep up with what's coming up. If you're into Twitter, might also be a good idea to be on the lookout for right hashtags.

So, I arrived jet-lagged, and about to attend the first keynote very shortly, so I'll be back with more details in a bit.
