You all know that stereotype about programmers, right? Especially Hollywood loves to keep that idea about Silicon Valley nerds alive and breathing. That we live and breathe to code, non-programmers have to constantly remind us to "speak English and not jargon", how we do nothing but code from morning till night, no matter if we are getting paid for it or not.

I'm sure people like that exist but I'm not sure I know any personally. 

I'll talk about ...

- coding can be just your job
- junior, helps to get in
- uni, html, css, myspace
- other skills
- rest, variance in tasks, not everything can be 110%

## Education

I began my journey to be a developer in my mid-20s when I started studying computer science at a university. In the beginning I was very nervous about fitting in and not being "outed as a hoax" because I thought everybody else knew how to code before coming to university. At least in Finland the stereotype about knowing how to code before going to a school to learn how to code sits very tight. I think very few of those students who I spent my first year with actually knew any coding. You wouldn't expect a person starting at a medical school to already know how to do surgery or to make diagnosis so why should computer science students know how to code?

The stereotype about self-learned coders can be motivating to some. And sure, there are much worse ways for a teenager to spend their time. But how many great developers has the industry missed, because someone didn't have the time or the means as a kid to learn programming? Not everybody has a good enough computer at home that allows them to learn and develop their skills. Or they might have a computer at home, but they need to share it with the rest of the family. Especially if the decision about one's future career has to be made around your teenage years, the current stereotypes about programmers surely do not encourage to seek the profession if you do not have had the opportunity to learn.

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with teaching kids some coding or being interested and learning stuff by yourself. However, people should also be taught that you can start learning programming at any age. Going to a school to learn computer science or information technology without any previous knowledge is totally fine. It's called a _school_ for a reason, right?

## Getting a job

Getting your first job as a programmer can either be easy as heck or the most stressful thing in your entire year. When I was in university, my friends who had time, energy, and interest to do serious hobby projects

## Keeping your job

No job in the world is static and stays the same. And software development is definitely not a field to change slowly. Being a professional developer you need to keep up with the new stuff. But that's the great part about this job! There is so much to learn and so many ways to develop your own skills further. 

But that does not mean that you need to use your own free time to do all that learning. And obviously, if you want to make a more drastic move in your professional path, you might need to invest some

## Conclusion

So, is it necessary to work on your hobby projects in order to get a job as a developer? Absolutely not. If you're a junior or have very little experience in the field you're applying to, it will probably help a lot. But
