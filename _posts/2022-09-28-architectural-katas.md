## Foreword

Continuous learning is part of [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) way of working. At Solita we experimented using the Architectural Katas -exercise to learn software architecture designing skills together and to "cross-pollinate" knowledge between teams and projects. Here's how of one such session held at a Solita office went.

## Architectural Katas

### What

The Software Architecture Katas is a method for learning how to design software architecture in a group and sharing that knowledge between participants and groups.
It is a lightweight group exercise which requires from little to no preparation work.

### Why

Software architecture design work is a practice which usually is not done continuously. The majority of design work is usually focused on the beginning phase of software projects.
Also, sometims software architecture design work is an amendment of an already existing design.
This leads to the problem of how can you learn and improve a skill, if you get to practice it only now and then? 

Here's where Architecture Katas comes to the rescue.

### How

The Software Architecture Katas method is explained well by e.g.[http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas](http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas/). Do check that out for more details, it is a quick read.

In short:

- Select an organizer
- Select a Kata
  - Select one Architectural Kata scenario as the same exercise subject for all groups if you want to compare group results. We chose this in order to stimulate discussion and have fun together.
  - Alternatively you may select a different Kata for each groups if you want to study different use-cases in the same exercise session
  - [List](http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas/list.html) of katas or a [random](http://fundamentalsofsoftwarearchitecture.com/katas/random.html) kata
- Select one person to play the role of a customer
  - The customer shall familiarize oneself beforehand with the selected Kata. Don't worry, they're pretty straightforward!
- Organize a meeting, for example 2 - 2,5h in total
  - A face-to-face meeting is most effective, but remote via shared screen is possible
  - Set time limits depending on the number of groups, for example:
    - 15 minutes for introduction and forming groups
    - 45 - 60 minutes for group work
    - 30 - 60 minutes for presentations and wrap-up
  - Form groups
    - Avoid having current team members in the same group
  - Customer presents the Kata scenario using 1 - 3 slides
    - Groups may ask questions from Customer after the presentation and during the group work
  - Groups move to a suitable place to do the group work using a whiteboard, post-it notes or any other preferred weapon of choise
  - After the group work timeslot is over each group presents their solution and reasoning
    - Other groups may ask questions
    - The other groups do a quick voting round. Groups vote if the solution is good for the scenario, if solution misses it badly or if solutions is something in between. Voting can be done for example using hands: thumbs up, thumbs down or thumbs to the side.

## Experiences

### On innovation

In innovation what matters is quantity over quality, regardless of if you are doing it alone or within a group.
Quantity in other words means producing as many ideas as possible - both suitable *and* bad!
Quantity is important because in innovation the best idea is usually a *synthesis of several alternatives*. Stopping after the first solution candidate is likely to miss variations which would make it even better. Keep in mind that there are many different approaches and solutions to a problem.
Software specialists have the same problem as people in general: if you have a hammer, then all problems look like nails.
That's why it is important to encourage the quiet members of a group to bring their own point of view to the table. People have different points of view and different observations, ones which others may have missed.

### On Architectural Katas

We found the Architectural Katas method to be a good fit for for the purpose.
What's especially important, is how the exercise is good fit for **sharing knowledge between different project teams** or **teams from different organisations**. Those typically work on different business domains and different design challenges. Sharing approaches coming from such different environments is interesting and fun!

During Architectural Katas innovation and design happens first within a group. Then a second time during then the presentation and discussion part where the diverse ways to tackle the problems are shared, explained and challenged.
We found the Architectural Katas exercise to be enjoyable and a good way to share knowledge. The exercise was interesting and we plan to have the exercise regularly.

Thoughts on how to carry out the exercise

- If a key skill is required to be included in each group, consider shuffling groups to balance the skills. On the other hand, you may accept this and see how it turns out.
- It is important to avoid having current team members are not together. This reduces the "doing it like we always do" phenomenon and also shares the "cross-project" and "cross-domain" experiences.
- If you have carried out the exercise already a few times and want to create variation, you can try having the Customer overlook mentioning some important quirk or a need. This is what often happens in real life. The constraint should be such that it can be detected when a team asks questions. This will coach the teams the importance of asking questions.
- Alternatively you may add a constraint or requirement, for example:  "technology X cannot/must be used".

Cheers, see you in the next workshop!
