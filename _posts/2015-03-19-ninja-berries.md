title: Ninja berries – how continuous learning works at this company

[Andrew Hunt and David Thomas](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) list these principles for managing your professional knowledge portfolio:

> Invest regularly.

> Diversify.

> Manage Risk (balance conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments!).

> Buy low, sell high (consider early investment in emerging technologies).

> Review and balance (keep it up to date).


These are slightly abbreviated for clarity, but the Hunt & Thomas book is solid; read it.

My current employer Solita is a Finnish mid-size (300+) organisation that specialises in services.  We design and code for money. This blog outlines how professional learning is facilitated at the company.  I also share something about things that in some ways feel just great.

Now it is great that my employer allows me to attend to any available educational session on company time, isn't it?

These practices were not born out of the blue.  They have their champions.  Particularly our current and ex coordinators of trainings [Timo Lehtonen](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=144187910) and [Anna Rautiainen](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=11016302) deserve a mention here, first and foremost.  Cheers and thank you!

Timo and Anna would confirm that the topic of trainings is a bit controversial in the corporate world.  To cut a long story short, employer and employee interests diverge by definition.  Learning is not directly productive in the traditional sense.

Whereas learning is an immediate investment for the employer, its results are hard to measure.  An easy solution would be to regard professional knowledge as the employee's private property, and channel company money to other ends.  This is the common solution.  

It takes some trouble, case by case, to argue how learning this or that would benefit a company's immediate concerns.  And as the general case goes, it seems totally impossible to give anything else than broad generalisations like "learning is good".  There is a different solution, too:  trust the employee, let them choose.

A smart and ethical employee, of course, will choose a smart and ethical thing to do.  Pardon me for watering down the traditional [rational action theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory).

Now looping back to Hunt's & Thomas' *Diversify* principle, it may benefit me personally in the long run if I learn something quite unrelated to what I work with now, cutting thus down the risks of my other investments, but then again productivity in my current main responsibilities may feel more desirable.  (Welcome to the land of internal arguments.)  I actually feel a moral pang if I take some time for study, even if I remain within all accepted workload expectations.  How selfish to look at something interesting!  I could be doing some concrete and useful thing with that time!

##My take at our context for a competition of interests

The resources of an organisation, of course, largely determine its internal educational policy.  Our post–internet world seems to me like a great competition of interests, where no simple strategy will dominate for long.  Nor is business immune to that infinite chorus of tiny calls.  The structuring of learning at Solita resembles the structure of the internet to some extent.  We do things that we find leading to other things.

Here's a small peek at the past two weeks and the week to follow, listing internal educational sessions given at our largest meeting room.  Some sessions given at other locations are missing from this list.

- Data visualisations with Clojurescript
- 50 new things in Java 8
- Git workshop (+)
- Solita IT starter pack
- Solita Science meetup (+)
- Solita company starter pack
- User centered design
- Product ownership
- Apache Cassandra, short facts (+)
- The case of point-to-point integrations
- Tips for accessibility
- Dynamic cubes
- Clojure basics
- Powershell
- Lean UX

(I've marked the ones I attended to with a + sign.)

Now more than 15 professionals chose to voluntarily take the trouble and prepare a meeting, ranging from 30 minutes up to two hours.  Why did they care – and did they gain something from it?

Solita's Marketing, Design, Dev, BI, and Analytics departments provide a range of professional topics that holds surprises for everybody involved.  The situation may not be unique, yet it almost seems an anomaly that you can cherry pick from this kind of repertoire what your employer pays you to know.

##A community of responsible grown-ups?

At Solita we have aimed for some level of coincidence of the separate interests of employee, employer and their customer.

First of all, as regards learning, it can be done on company time.  Like I mentioned in [a previous post](/2015/01/26/monster-fighter.html), intra–company educational sessions can be freely attended to, and there also is a reserved amount of time for self studies; watching educational videos, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and so on.

To counteract these temptations, as they will always seem to me, there is a personalised target utilisation percentage at place, triggering some dreaded "Only so much billed work on week x" mails every now and then.  This of course is based on employee work hour records, which are written down to the accuracy of ```0.5h``` – an invaluable dataset if you look at it from that perspective.

I'm slightly diverging, but could we predict, by asking a relevant question from that data, along with version control commits, etc., a time an employee should be sent to buy themselves a beer or something?  How would it feel from employee perspective?  Could we detect an early signal of decreasing productivity, track it down and take corrective measures before a problem gets out of hands?  When should we care?

##Levels of decision

My nights have been full of thrills lately.  Both of our youngest, my four year old son with his toddler sister, got sick – yielding a nightly output of a vomit per an hour.  This has been going on for the last 48 hours.  Now you might think that *ninja berries* refers to those strange orange–white clumps commonly found in that product, whatever!

Going through these personal headaches, it is super great that I can do my own prioritisation at work time, especially on a zombie day like this when logical thinking seems a no–can–do, write a post or whatever.

This relative freedom of decision was trumpeted in the past by Agile, Scrum, and other production methodologies.  Their common premise is to avoid micromanagement and let the "resource" itself decide its next step.  (Let's provide the cage, management said...)  This same idea, of individual choice within a target driven environment, is transported to the realm of learning here, and it seems to be working fairly well at Solita from what I can judge.

Here are the symptoms:

- an increasing number of professionals kick up short educational meetings, "info strikes"
- there is a positive feeling about sharing and communication in the company
- meetings end up with discussion and questions, leading to short problem solving discussions at best
- there is cross department interaction, which is nice

Knowledge is a free good that has a widely varying density.


**Tl;dr**:  *Our 300+ employees can cherry pick from and kick up educational sessions at Solita, which is nice and seems to work well.*
