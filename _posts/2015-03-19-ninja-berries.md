My employer allows me to attend to any available educational session on company time.  Great, isn't it, and perhaps a bit naive?

Solita is a Finnish 300+ employee company that specialises in services.  We design and code for money.

Here's a snapshot from the past two weeks and the week to follow, listing internal educational sessions given at our largest meeting room, in one of our three offices.  Sessions given at other locations are missing from this list (we share sittings over video though).

- Data visualisations with Clojurescript
- 50 new things in Java 8
- Git workshop (+)
- Solita IT starter pack
- Solita Science meetup (+)
- Solita company starter pack
- User centered design
- Product ownership
- Apache Cassandra, short facts (+)
- The case of point-to-point integrations
- Tips for accessibility
- Dynamic cubes
- Clojure basics
- Powershell
- Lean UX

I've marked the ones I attended to with a + sign.

Now more than 15 professionals chose to take the trouble and arrange a meeting.  Did they gain something from it?

##Learning on company time

Like I mentioned in [a previous post](/2015/01/26/monster-fighter.html), we have a company policy that intra–company educational sessions can be freely attended to.  There is a reserved amount of time for self studies too; watching educational videos, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and so on.

You could say that we are somewhat closer to a collective than a traditional company is.  This perhaps is affected by our branch of business.

To counteract excessive educational temptations, as they would appear, there is a personalised target utilisation percentage at place, triggering some dreaded "Only so much billed work on week x" mails every now and then.  This of course is based on employee work hour records, which are written down to the accuracy of ```0.5h``` – an invaluable dataset if you look at it from that perspective.

Preparing an educational session for others then is settled from a separate cost pool, so it need not consume your personal study hours, although it shows up in your organisational unit's costs.

In this way Solita aims for a level of coincidence of the separate interests of employee, employer and their customer.

##Discussion

Learning at Solita resembles the structure of the internet to some extent.  We do things that we find leading to other things.  There are some evolving protocols and boundary rules which enable this system keep rolling.

Our interest in continuous learning springs from many sources, but one of them is competence.

[Andrew Hunt and David Thomas](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) list these principles for managing your professional knowledge portfolio:

> Invest regularly.

> Diversify.

> Manage Risk (balance conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments!).

> Buy low, sell high (consider early investment in emerging technologies).

> Review and balance (keep it up to date).


These are slightly abbreviated for clarity, but the Hunt & Thomas book is solid; read it.

Getting back to Solita, its practices are partly a community effort, partly developed by our current and ex coordinators of trainings [Timo Lehtonen](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=144187910) and [Anna Rautiainen](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=11016302), who deserve a mention here, first and foremost.  Cheers and thank you!

Timo and Anna would confirm that the topic of trainings is a bit controversial in the corporate world.  To cut a long story short, employer and employee interests diverge by definition.  Learning is not directly productive in the traditional sense.  Also the resources of an organisation must largely determine its educational policy.

Learning is an immediate investment for the employer, but its results vary, being hard to measure.  An easy solution would be to regard professional knowledge as the employee's private property, and channel company money to other ends.  This is the common solution.  

I think it takes some trouble, case by case, to argue how learning this or that would benefit a company's immediate concerns.  And as the general case goes, it seems totally impossible to give anything more than generalisations like "learning is good".  Solita has chosen to trust its employees and let them choose.  This gives a borderline between personal and shared different to the traditional solution, with totally new pros and cons.

An employee then is expected to choose those topics that will benefit their competence and work the most.  They may not succeed always, but this is how the market works.  (Pardon me for watering down the traditional [rational action theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory).)

Now looping back to Hunt's & Thomas' *Diversify* principle, it may benefit me personally in the long run if I learn something quite unrelated to my current tasks, cutting down the risks of my other investments. But then again productivity in my current main responsibilities may often feel more desirable.  In my personal experience, a choice between interesting new topics and established topics is very hard.  It can feel a little selfish to look at something interesting if I could be doing concrete and useful work with that time.

But then again my professional competence and problem solving skills will benefit from an occasional break.

Here the positive consequences of sharing are estimated higher than the opportunity cost that goes with it.

##Conclusion

My nights have been full of thrills lately.  Both of our youngest, my four year old son with his toddler sister, got sick – yielding a nightly vomit per an hour or so.  This has been going on for the last 48 hours.  Now you might think that *ninja berries* refers to those strange orange–white clumps commonly found in that product, whatever!

Going through these personal headaches, it is super great that I can do my own prioritisation at work time, especially on a zombie day like this when logical thinking seems a no–can–do, write a post or take some less important and lower priorised tasks.  I'm not into learning today, being as tired as I am.

This relative freedom of decision was trumpeted in the past by Agile, Scrum, and other production methodologies.  Their common premise is to avoid micromanagement and let the "resource" itself decide its next step.  (Let's provide the cage, management said...)  This same idea, of individual choice within a target driven environment, is transported to the realm of learning here, and it seems to be working fairly well at Solita from what I can judge.

Here are some symptoms:

- an increasing number of professionals kick up short educational meetings, "info strikes"
- there is a positive feeling about sharing and communication in the company
- meetings end up with discussion and questions, leading to short problem solving discussions at best
- there is cross department interaction, which is nice

Well, I was thinking of writing something about company level chatrooms too, but it did not fit in, so I'll reserve it for another post.  Thanks for reading.


**Tl;dr**:  *Our 300+ employees can cherry pick from and kick up educational sessions at Solita, which is nice and seems to work well at a company that sells coding services.*
