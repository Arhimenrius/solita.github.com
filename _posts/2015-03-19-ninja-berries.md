title: Ninja berries – how continuous learning works @here

excerpt: Here's a small peek internal educational sessions given at our company.
---
My employer allows me to attend to any available educational session on company time.  Great, isn't it, and perhaps a bit naive?

Solita is a Finnish mid-size (300+) organisation that specialises in services.  We design and code for money. This blog outlines how professional learning is done here.  I also share my rationalisations about the underpinnings.

[Andrew Hunt and David Thomas](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) list these principles for managing your professional knowledge portfolio:

> Invest regularly.

> Diversify.

> Manage Risk (balance conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments!).

> Buy low, sell high (consider early investment in emerging technologies).

> Review and balance (keep it up to date).


These are slightly abbreviated for clarity, but the Hunt & Thomas book is solid; read it.

Getting back to Solita, its practices were not born out of the blue.  Particularly our current and ex coordinators of trainings [Timo Lehtonen](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=144187910) and [Anna Rautiainen](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=11016302) deserve a mention here, first and foremost.  Cheers and thank you!

Timo and Anna would confirm that the topic of trainings is a bit controversial in the corporate world.  To cut a long story short, employer and employee interests diverge by definition.  Learning is not directly productive in the traditional sense.

Whereas learning is an immediate investment for the employer, its results are hard to measure.  An easy solution would be to regard professional knowledge as the employee's private property, and channel company money to other ends.  This is the common solution.  

It takes some trouble, case by case, to argue how learning this or that would benefit a company's immediate concerns.  And as the general case goes, it seems totally impossible to give anything more than generalisations like "learning is good".  Solita has enforced a different solution, of course, trusting its employees, and letting them choose.  This gives a different borderline between personal/shared than the traditional solution, with new and different pros and cons.

A smart and ethical employee then will choose a smart and ethical thing to do.  (Pardon me for watering down the traditional [rational action theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory).)

Now looping back to Hunt's & Thomas' *Diversify* principle, it may benefit me personally in the long run if I learn something quite unrelated to my current tasks, cutting down the risks of my other investments. But then again productivity in my current main responsibilities may feel more desirable.  (Welcome to the land of internal arguments.)

As it stands, it can (and perhaps should?) feel selfish to look at something interesting.  I could be doing some concrete and useful thing with that time.

##My take at the culture context

The resources of an organisation must largely determine its internal educational policy.  Our post–internet world seems to me like a great competition of interests, where no simple strategy will dominate for long.  Business is not immune to that infinite chorus of tiny calls.

The structuring of learning at Solita resembles the structure of the internet to some extent.  We do things that we find leading to other things.  There are some evolving protocols and boundary rules which enable this system keep rolling.

Here's a small peek at the past two weeks and the week to follow, listing internal educational sessions given at our largest meeting room.  Some sessions given at other locations are missing from this list.

- Data visualisations with Clojurescript
- 50 new things in Java 8
- Git workshop (+)
- Solita IT starter pack
- Solita Science meetup (+)
- Solita company starter pack
- User centered design
- Product ownership
- Apache Cassandra, short facts (+)
- The case of point-to-point integrations
- Tips for accessibility
- Dynamic cubes
- Clojure basics
- Powershell
- Lean UX

(I've marked the ones I attended to with a + sign.)

Now more than 15 professionals chose to voluntarily take the trouble and prepare a meeting, ranging from 30 minutes up to two hours.  Why did they care – and did they gain something from it?

Solita's Marketing, Design, Dev, BI, and Analytics departments provide a range of professional topics that holds surprises for everybody involved.  The situation may not be unique, yet it seems almost like an anomaly to me that you can cherry pick from this kind of repertoire what your employer pays you to know.

##A community of responsible grown-ups?

At Solita we have aimed for some level of coincidence of the separate interests of employee, employer and their customer.

First of all, as regards learning, it can be done on company time.  Like I mentioned in [a previous post](/2015/01/26/monster-fighter.html), intra–company educational sessions can be freely attended to, and there also is a reserved amount of time for self studies; watching educational videos, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and so on.  Preparing an educational session for others is settled from a separate cost pool, so it need not consume your personal study hours, although it shows up in your organisational unit's costs.

To counteract excessive educational temptations, as would appear, there is a personalised target utilisation percentage at place, triggering some dreaded "Only so much billed work on week x" mails every now and then.  This of course is based on employee work hour records, which are written down to the accuracy of ```0.5h``` – an invaluable dataset if you look at it from that perspective.

I'm slightly diverging, but could we predict, by asking a relevant question from that data, along with version control commits, etc., a time an employee should be sent to buy themselves a beer or something?  How would it feel from employee perspective?  Could we detect an early signal of decreasing productivity, track it down and take corrective measures before a problem gets out of hands?  When should we care?

##Levels of decision

My nights have been full of thrills lately.  Both of our youngest, my four year old son with his toddler sister, got sick – yielding a nightly vomit per an hour or so.  This has been going on for the last 48 hours.  Now you might think that *ninja berries* refers to those strange orange–white clumps commonly found in that product, whatever!

Going through these personal headaches, it is super great that I can do my own prioritisation at work time, especially on a zombie day like this when logical thinking seems a no–can–do, write a post or take some less important and lower priorised tasks.  I'm not into learning today, being as tired as I am.

This relative freedom of decision was trumpeted in the past by Agile, Scrum, and other production methodologies.  Their common premise is to avoid micromanagement and let the "resource" itself decide its next step.  (Let's provide the cage, management said...)  This same idea, of individual choice within a target driven environment, is transported to the realm of learning here, and it seems to be working fairly well at Solita from what I can judge.

Here are the symptoms:

- an increasing number of professionals kick up short educational meetings, "info strikes"
- there is a positive feeling about sharing and communication in the company
- meetings end up with discussion and questions, leading to short problem solving discussions at best
- there is cross department interaction, which is nice

Well, I was thinking of writing something about company level chatrooms too, but it did not fit in, so I'll reserve it for another post.  Thanks for reading.


**Tl;dr**:  *Our 300+ employees can cherry pick from and kick up educational sessions at Solita, which is nice and seems to work well.*
