## Introduction: The Dawn of AI in Software Development

We've seen and use machine learning and Large Language Models for decades, depending on the definition. In 1960s there was already a chatbot named Eliza, so there's nothing new in concept of AI or Chatbots. Even AI tools for software development are not new. I have been using Github Copilot for quite some time, and experienced the boost in productivity it brings.

But 2023 we saw something new emerge: A chatbot that seems to understand what you're saying and can even write code for you. ChatGPT popularized and accelerated the use of general purpose AI LLM-based AI - not just in software development, but in all areas of life. It has also immensely boosted other AI developments that deal with images, music, videos, and speech.

Ironically this eplosion of AI that is still ongoing seems to have most impact in the areas we thought would not be effected by AI - the creative arts and innovation, for example writing, photography, music, videos, speech interfaces, and software development. Modern AIs can already give a pretty decent shot at generating all of this is a credible manner.

So naturally there's been big concerns if this would make software development and software developers obsolete. And opinions that it will just augment developers, and create even more work. I don't have a crystal ball here, but I do believe it will make those software developer obsolete that refuse to learn new and productive ways of looking at software development. Hence this blog article - I will assemble some of my thoughts and experiences in hopes that it will help you to get started with ChatGPT and maximize your productivity.

## Demystifying New Languages: ChatGPT as Your Polyglot Partner

Learning a new programming language can be intimidating, like exploring a foreign land with just a map and a phrasebook. With countless languages out there, keeping up may seem like an uphill battle.

Enter ChatGPT, your AI companion that's versed in the vast landscape of programming languages. It’s here to make your journey through new languages less daunting. It’s your personal guide, fluent in Python, Java, Typescript, C++, Rust, and more. Dang, it even knows more esoteric languages like Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang, Cobol, or Commodore 64 Basic language. It works marvels when you need a bit of Bash scripting, or a regex to parse some text.

ChatGPT, trained on an immense amount of internet text, uses machine learning to predict text sequences. Ask it how to define a JavaScript function, and it’ll generate a response, just like an experienced coder guiding you. If you don't like it, you can ask it to refine it as long as you like. It's like having a coding buddy who's always there to help, and never gets tired or too busy to help.

Imagine you're a Python guru tasked with a Ruby project. You can turn to ChatGPT for guidance, asking "How do I iterate over an array in Ruby?" or "What's Ruby's equivalent of Python's list comprehension?" Expect clear, natural-language responses to help you traverse the language gap. If the code fails to compile, you can feed in the error you got, and ask for guidance. If your tools are not in order, you can ask for help in installing and setting up Python.

ChatGPT isn’t just a coding tool—it’s your programming partner. It provides explanations, answers your queries, and engages in dialogue until you grasp a concept. It’s here to empower you, not replace you. But remember, it’s not perfect—it's a guide, not the ultimate truth. Always corroborate its suggestions with your own research. It's like a slightly demented senior developer that is most of the time correct and cool, but now and then tends to drift off to memories and hallucinate things that do not exist. You know, it may feel like having me around.

## Beyond Writing Code: Generation, Documentation, and Translation

You might think that ordinary workday of a software developer consists of writing a lot of code. But that's not the case. Writing code is actually just a small part, and has been augmented a lot already with IDE plugins that help generating code. But within software developer's typical workday, most of the time is spent on other things, like designing code, reading code, debugging, testing, documenting, and translating. Soemtimes even providing impactful presentations, or sending emails. And those are especially the things where ChatGPT can help you.

Wrestling with a poorly documented codebase? ChatGPT's got your back. It's a whiz at explaining code in simple, clear language, turning even the most cryptic legacy code into a readable story. You can ask for summaries, or create actual documentation that you can copy-paste to proper places.

Writing test code seems like a chore? No worries, just ask ChatGPT to write a good basis for your tests, while you just finished writing the code. Better yet, use TDD. Give some specifications, ask ChatGPT to write tests for it, then iterate the tests until happy. Then ask ChatGPT to create code based on the tests.

Got some code to refactor? ChatGPT can help you there, too. It's a master at generating code, and can even refactor existing code. Just ask it to "refactor this code", and it will do it's best to make it better. It's not perfect, but it's a good starting point. You can help this by giving it some examples of what you want to achieve, and it will try to do it for you. Or you can offer some stylistic advice, for example: Please refactor this code in a more functional manner.

ChatGPT speaks multiple programming languages. Need to translate a Java method into Python? Just ask. While it's not flawless, it gives you a solid starting point, saving hours of manual translation. And as mentioned in previous chapter, while your primary programming language may be fresh in your memory with up-to-date information, ChatGPT shines in helping you with languages you don't use that often.

ChatGPT isn't just a tool — it's your AI-powered partner, a co-pilot, ready to transform your software development journey. It's here to generate, document, and translate code, empowering you to be more productive. Remember, it's not a replacement for human ingenuity but a valuable ally that amplifies your capabilities.

## Creativity at Your Fingertips: Unexpected Applications of ChatGPT

It's been said there's only four difficult things in programming: Naming things, dealing with dates, and off-by-one errors.

ChatGPT can help you with all of those. It's a master at naming things, and can help you with naming variables, functions, classes, and even projects. It's also a master at dealing with dates, and can help you with date calculations, formatting, and parsing. And it's also a master at dealing with off-by-one errors, and can help you with those. It even does bad jokes!

Struggling to come up with that perfect variable or project name? ChatGPT is your creative co-pilot. Tap into its vast knowledge and let it suggest names that are not only meaningful but also follow good naming practices. It's like having a brainstorming partner that's ready to go 24/7.

Beyond just code, ChatGPT can be your ally in ideation stages. Stuck on a feature design or need a fresh perspective on a project? Pitch your problem to ChatGPT. Its responses can spark new ideas and push your thinking in unexpected directions.

Creativity isn't just about artistic endeavor—it's about problem-solving and innovation. With ChatGPT, you have an AI partner that can inject a dose of creativity into your coding process, whether you're naming a variable or planning your next big project.

## Navigating the AI Terrain: Risk Management with ChatGPT

There's obviously some caveats and concerns to mention here:

Ownership of the data and models. If you use OpenAI-hosted ChatGPT, you're giving them access to your data and models. This is a concern for many, and there's been some high-profile cases of people and companies being banned from using ChatGPT. In EU, there's been even country-wide banning of services. This is why many companies are using self-hosted ChatGPT models, and why Microsoft is offering ChatGPT as a service within Azure cloud. OpenAI has improved the data controls so you can currently decide if you want to preserve conversation histories or use the data you input for training the model, but it still leaves a lot to hope for, and stops people using it for many purposes.

In other words, if the input data you feed in only contains public information, you're probably fine. But if you're feeding in confidential or proprietary information, you should be very careful. And if you're feeding in classified information, or personally identifiable information, you should not be using ChatGPT at all. In many cases even source code can be considered confidential or proprietary information, so you should be careful with that as well. If you don't know you should err on side of caution. If you want to use ChatGPT or GPT models with confidential or sensitive information, you should use self-hosted models, and make sure you have proper data controls in place.

Accuracy of the responses. ChatGPT is not perfect. It can generate responses that are inaccurate, inappropriate, or even offensive. With generated source code, it may and will create code that does not compile, or even worse, code that compiles but does not do what you want it to do. It may seem fine and even compile, but there's no guarantees if it makes sense in wider context, follows best practices, or is even secure. In other words, whatever you use ChatGPT for, you should always review the responses it generates before sending them out or using them in any way. This is especially true if you're using ChatGPT for business purposes, as it could have a negative impact on your company's reputation if you send out inaccurate or inappropriate responses. This has already happened.

Model only knows things up to 2021, at this moment, so it's unaware of new things, tools, APIs, since then. Ironically it is not up to date with the burst of AI tooling that's happened in 2023. Granted, you can use web browsing plugins to fix that issue, but that is multiplies of slower and less accurate than using what's available within the model. A clever way to work around this that's emerging is ability to feed in your own documents, or library of knowledge, and be able to query based on that. Unlike the freeform web searching, a custom knowledge base may be indexed for faster recovery. This is something that's already available in some of the self-hosted models, and will no doubt be available in OpenAI-hosted models as well.




## Conclusion: Embracing the Future of Coding with ChatGPT

So, to summarize a few keypoints:

- Be careful with the data you feed in - only feed in data and code you're comfortable with sharing with OpenAI. It's currently a bit more invasive tool than for example GitHub Copilot.
- Consider the self-hosted models when available, otherwise you may limit to how much you can use it.
- Always verify, validate, do not simply copy-paste or autogenerate. At least not yet...
- Be aware of the limitations of the model, and how to work around them.
- Be bold and active with experimentation. Even if you cannot currently use it for your work projects, you can still use it for your hobby projects, and learn from that. You can also use it for learning, and for inspiration. And you should, you really should.
- Find a workflow that augments your work. Meaning, find the places where you get the most boost, with least effort. It's okay to experiment widely, but eventually settling down to a productive workflow is the key
- Expect things to evolve rapidly. ChatGPT is not a finished product, it's a work in progress. It's a glimpse of the future, and it's going to be a wild ride. But it's going to be worth it. Stay up to date.
- Don't get overwhelmed. When you do, go outside, take a walk. Listen to silence. Turn off AI news, work old school manually with a hobby project, just for fun. Do what works for you, but the speed of things currently can have and has an overwhelming effect on developers, so try to be aware of that and try to manage that.

My predictions for 2023 and 2024?

It's obvious there will be more crazy evolution to come up. Many of the flaws,shortcomings, caveats, and risks will be fixed, many new ones will be found. There's already crazy movement in projects like Langchain, AutoGPT, open source smaller GPT models, more customized special purpose GPT models, where you can host them anywhere and manage your data as you like, yourself.

Models will be integrated with existing products, like Office tools, chat platforms, a lot of this has already been done but expect a lot more.

Obvious things that can be fixed are privacy and security concerns, costs of using the models, defining the knowledge bases and data sources being used. I would also expect us to see improvements in self-validating the answers. There is already solutions to try and avoid the hallucinations, or invalid code, or nonexistant libraries, or imaginary references to nonexistant things - but they will only improve in the near future.

Oh, and this blog article was written in co-operation with ChatGPT and some clever prompting. Some manual old-fashioned human work was also involved. Can you spot the difference?
